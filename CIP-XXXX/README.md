## Abstract

This CIP defines a voluntary Code of Conduct Template for Delegated Representatives (DReps) under Voltaire era on-chain governance for Cardano. This template provides a framework for DReps and other governance actors to self-regulate through adopting a code that expresses values, disclosures, and transparent practices that enhance accountability and build delegator trust.

## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?

  Under the governance model specified in CIP-1694, DReps play a central role in Cardano’s decision-making. The Code of Conduct Template encourages DReps and other governance actors to adopt practices that strengthen transparency and governance accountability, allowing delegators to make informed decisions.

## Specification

This CIP outlines a series of voluntary disclosures that may be used as a Code of Conduct Template.

> The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC2119].

These recommended disclosures are grouped into six key areas:

### 1. Disclosure of Knowledge

DReps should demonstrate their understanding of key governance areas to provide assurances of informed decision-making.
-  Understanding of Governance: Disclose familiarity with CIP-1694, Cardano’s governance structure, and other relevant governance protocols.
-  Understanding of Technology: Disclose technical understanding of voting mechanics, secure key handling, and governance transaction processing.
-  Understanding of Related Domains: Disclose knowledge in related fields such as economics, blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), or other domains that may support governance decisions.

Example:
> “I have studied CIP-1694 and understand governance structures and secure key management. I am an accountant with an understanding of economic models that are important to the Cardano ecosystem.”

### 2. Disclosure of Resources

DReps should share their capacity to fulfill governance responsibilities, helping delegators evaluate their availability and support structures.

- Time Commitment: Specify the amount of time dedicated to DRep activities.
- Feedback Channels: Describe how they can receive feedback or information from the community, such as via email or social media.
- Organizational Affiliations: List any organizations or affiliations relevant to governance, such as DAOs or professional groups in the Cardano ecosystem.

Example:
> “I will commit 10 hours per month to DRep responsibilities and can be reached at [email] for inquiries. I am a member of the [token] NFT Community and consult other members of our DAO on important issues.”

### 3. Disclosure of Identity

DReps should provide information on their identity or known aliases to offer delegators transparency around their representation in the community. This may include their legal names.

- Preferred Identification: Outline how the DRep prefers to be identified (e.g., pseudonymously, through DID, or publicly).
- Community Activity: Indicate if the DRep is known in the community under other names or accounts.

Example:
> “I am known in the community as [username], and I am reachable under that alias on [platform].  I have received a Catalyst Grant for [project]”

### 4. Disclosure of Collaboration

DReps should share any alliances or endorsements that might influence their decisions.
- Governance Team or Alliance Membership: Declare any team or coalition memberships that may influence voting patterns.
- Endorsements: Disclose any endorsements accepted from individuals or groups within or outside the Cardano ecosystem.

Example:
>“I am a member of the XYZ governance coalition, which endorses my DRep activities.”

### 5. Disclosure of Voting Process

DReps should describe how they approach decision-making and ways they will share their reasonings.
- Voting Decision-Making Process: Describe how the DRep plans to approach voting decisions, including factors they consider.
- Communication of Voting Rationales: Detail how and where voting rationales will be communicated (e.g., forums, websites) and what metadata standards will be used.

Example:
> “I use community feedback and technical analysis to guide voting decisions. I plan to publish rationales on [website] and will adhere to recommended metadata standards for voting actions.”

### 6. Disclosure of Economic Interests

DReps should share any economic interests that may be perceived as cause for bias so that delegates can assess potential conflicts of interest.

- Employment or Project Representation: Disclose any employment or representation agreements that may influence governance decisions within the Cardano ecosystem.
- Handling of Votes Affecting Personal Economic Interests: Explain the DRep’s approach to handling votes that may impact projects or communities they have economic stakes in.

Example:
> “I am a representative of [project] and hold economic interests in [related projects] but I will not let any economic interests bias my voting decisions. I will disclose any large project connections that may relate to a Governance Action I am considering in my DRep Blog before casting a vote and invite delegators who disagree with my decision to change their representation if they feel it is necessary.”

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?

Creating a Code of Conduct is voluntary. DReps may choose to adopt one to demonstrate their commitment to transparency and governance values. Disclosures can be made publicly through community forums, personal websites, or on-chain governance metadata.

A voluntary Code of Conduct encourages transparency and helps build a resilient governance ecosystem. By focusing on self-disclosure and open practices, this CIP provides a flexible approach that can adapt as governance requirements evolve on Cardano.

## Acknowledgements

This proposal incorporates insights from the DRep Code of Conduct workshops, the DRep Pioneer Program, and discussions with community members on governance transparency and accountability.

## Path to Active

This CIP will become active in Cardano Governance once it is put forward to the Cardano Community as a Governance Info Action and approved by the DReps at the DRep Vote Threshold for Update to the Constitution (dvt_update_to_constitution) and the Constitutional Committee at the CC Threshold Level.  This CIP may not be updated unless the revision is approved in the same way.

### Acceptance Criteria

To be accepted and considered ratified, both this initial CIP and any subsequent changes or modifications to it **MUST** follow the following procedure.

While any future edits or modifications to this initial CIP are being made, the previous version shall be considered to be in force and active until such time as this CIP is formally repealed, modified, or replaced.
