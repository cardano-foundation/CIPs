## Abstract

This specification defines a user-facing asset fingerprint as a bech32-encoded blake2b-160 digest of the concatenation of the policy id and the asset name.

## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?

The Mary era of Cardano introduces the support for native assets. On the blockchain, native assets are uniquely identified by both their so-called policy id and asset name. Neither the policy id nor the asset name are intended to be human-readable data. 

On the one hand, the policy id is a hash digest of either a monetary script or a Plutus script. On the other hand, the asset name is an arbitrary bytestring of up to 32 bytes (which does not necessarily decode to a valid UTF-8 sequence). In addition, it is possible for an asset to have an empty asset name, or, for assets to have identical asset names under different policies. 

Because assets are manipulated in several user-facing features on desktop and via hardware applications, it is useful to come up with a short(er) and human-readable identifier for assets that user can recognize and refer to when talking about assets. We call such an identifier an _asset fingerprint_.

## Specification

We define the asset fingerprint in pseudo-code as:

```
assetFingerprint := encodeBech32
  ( datapart = hash
    ( algorithm = 'blake2b'
    , digest-length = 20
    , message = policyId | assetName
    )
  , humanReadablePart = 'asset'
  )
```

where `|` designates the concatenation of two byte strings. The `digest-length` is given in _bytes_ (so, 160 bits).

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?

### Design choices

- The asset fingerprint needs to be _somewhat unique_ (although collisions are plausible, see next section) and refer to a particular asset. It must therefore include both the policy id and the asset name.

- Using a hash gives us asset id of a same deterministic length which is short enough to display reasonably well on small screens.

- We use bech32 as a user-facing encoding since it is both user-friendly and quite common within the Cardano eco-system (e.g. addresses, pool ids, keys).

### Security Considerations

- With a 160-bit digest, an attacker needs at least 2^80 operations to find a collision. Although 2^80 operations is relatively low (it remains expansive but doable for an attacker), it 
  is considered safe within the context of an asset fingerprint as a mean of _user verification_ within a particular wallet. An attacker may obtain advantage if users can be persuaded 
  that a certain asset is in reality another (which implies to find a collision, and make both assets at the reach of the user). 

- We recommend however that in addition to the asset fingerprint, applications also show whenever possible a visual checksum calculated from the policy id and the asset name as specified in [CIP-YET-TO-COME](). Such generated images, which are designed to be unique and easy to distinguish, in combination with a readable asset fingerprint gives strong verification means to end users. 

## Path to Active

- [x] Asset fingerprints as described have been universally adopted in: wallets, blockchain explorers, query layers, token minting utilities, NFT specifications, and CLI tools.

### Implementation Plan

- [x] Reference implementations available in both Javascript and Haskell.
- [x] Public presentation with confirmed interest in adopting this standard in advance of Mary ledger era.
