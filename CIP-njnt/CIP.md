As Cardano scales, non-technical aspects become more prominent. 

In a recent surprise AMA Charles supported the trust of community members in the fact that what we do is ethical: anyone was able to ask any question, however uncomfortable. However in following years this commitment to openness might be hurtful. As complexity of the system increases, detection of corruption networks becomes less likely, thus it would be perilous to host such events: an informed individual with a selfish goal may harm either intangible tvl (by exposing know how and allowing competitors to replicate it) or Cardano reputation by forcing the official to refuse to talk about topics, thus breaking the promise of openness.

As Cardano aims to get international recognition by forming a digital nation, this becomes more and more likely and damaging. 

For Cardano to be able to counter that, we must form an Ethics commitee: this will leave Cardano with right to withhold information (technology X leads to extreme runoff: rich get richer, while everyone remains in 1984) while maintatining good public image.

The questions are:

How the commitee will work?
Do we need an outside observer bound by oath of silence?
Should we trust Unitarian Universalist association to be our ethics advisor?
Should we run ethics workshops as part of constitution workshops?
Are we in a simulation?
