## Abstract
<!-- A short (\~200 word) description of the target goals and the technical obstacles to those goals. -->
Cardano is a sect, we have to form an Ethics Working Group.

## Problem
<!-- A more elaborate description of the problem and its context. This section should explain what motivates the writing of the CPS document. -->
Cardano is a sect. Some people learned to treat life as play, some did not. Dogmaticism is widespread in most of the worlds regions. Dogmaticism leads to emotional repression: people have less opportunities to discuss their life from the religious perspective (as religion is often associated with dogma), and thus are more likely to experience frustration due to not realizing the actionable steps for improvement.

## Use cases
<!-- A concrete set of examples written from a user's perspective, describing what and why they are trying to do. When they exist, this section should give a sense of the current alternatives and highlight why they are not suitable. -->
2024, Intersect MBO, digital nation.

## Goals
Improve developer and user experience
<!-- A list of goals and non-goals a project is pursuing, ranked by importance. These goals should help understand the design space for the solution and what the underlying project is ultimately trying to achieve.

Goals may also contain requirements for the project. For example, they may include anything from a deadline to a budget (in terms of complexity or time) to security concerns.

Finally, goals may also serve as evaluation metrics to assess how good a proposed solution is. -->

## Open Questions
How it would work?
Who is an expert on the subject?
Are we in a simulation?
<!-- A set of questions to which any proposed solution should find an answer. Questions should help guide solutions design by highlighting some foreseen vulnerabilities or design flaws. Solutions in the form of CIP should thereby include these questions as part of their 'Rationale' section and provide an argued answer to each. -->
