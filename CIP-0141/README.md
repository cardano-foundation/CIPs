## Abstract

This document describes a CIP-30 extension allowing webpages (i.e., DApps) to interface with Cardano Plutus wallets. This interface is a work in progress, and new versions are expected to be included as the ecosystem evolves. 

## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?
  
Plutus wallets is a class of wallets where the holding address does not correspond to a public key, but to a script. This enables more complex validation logic to be implemented in the wallet, allowing for more complex spending conditions to be enforced.
  
Examples of Plutus wallets include :
  - Updatable Multi-signature wallets
  - Subscription wallets (wallet that allow for periodic payments to be made)
  - Maltifactor authetication wallets
  - Semi-custodial wallets
  - Tokenized wallets
  - EstatePlanning wallets
  - wallets controlled by non-cardano addresses
  
In order to facilitate future DApp development, we will need a way for DApps to communicate with Plutus wallets. Given the unique complexities of Plutus script-based addresses, special provisions need to be made to make the connector compatible with them.
  
### Rationale for the required data
  
  - Script descriptor: Any transaction consuming a UTXO from a Plutus-based address must attach the corresponding script.
  - `ScriptRequirement` list: 
      - DApps need to know the scriptContext under which the transaction will be validated.
      - DApps need to know the collateral donor to attach the collateral to the transaction.
      - DApps need to know the `Datum` of the UTXOs that it will be consuming.
      - DApps need to know the `Redeemers` that will be used in the transaction.
  - Change datum
      - DApps need to know the `Datum` that will be used as the change output for the transaction. This is mandatory for wallets based on Plutus v2 and before, as the change output must contain a datum to be valid and spendable.

## Specification

### Versioning

To facilitate future updates, the API will be versioned. Newer version of the API have to be compatible with the previous versions. 

The current version of the API is 2.0, the major version number is derived from the version of Plutus that the API implements, and the minor version number is used for incremental updates within the same version of Plutus.

### Data Types

#### KeyHash

A hex-encoded string of the corresponding bytes. This represents the hash of the public key used to sign transactions.

```ts
type KeyHash = String
```

#### ScriptRequirements

Script requirements encapsulate all the possible requirements for a transaction to be valid. It includes the following fields:

- collateral: The input that can be used as collateral for the transaction.
- inputs: The list of inputs that must be used as inputs for the transaction.
- reference_inputs: The list of inputs that must be used as reference inputs for the transaction.
- outputs: The list of outputs that must be included in the transaction.
- mint: The amount of tokens that must be minted/burned in the transaction.
- certificates: The list of certificates that must be included in the transaction.
- withdrawals: The list of withdrawals that must be included in the transaction.
- validity_range: The validity range that the transaction must be valid in.
- signatories: The list of signatories that must sign the transaction.
- redeemers: The list of redeemers required for the transaction, if the type is secret, the secretId will be provided to retrieve the secret from the wallet, if the type is signature, the redeemer will be a pair of [DataSpec, Signature].
- datums: The list of datums that should be used in the transaction for the change outputs, the wallet will use the first datum in the list that is valid for the current transaction, if more than one datum is valid, the wallet will use separate datums for each change output.


```ts
type ScriptRequirement = {
  collateral?: cbor<transaction_unspent_output>,
  inputs?: List<cbor<transaction_unspent_output>>,
  reference_inputs?: List<cbor<transaction_unspent_output>>,
  outputs?: List<transaction_output>,
  mint?: Value,
  certificates?: List<Certificate>,
  withdrawals?: Dict<StakeCredential, Int>,
  validity_range?: ValidityRange,
  signatories?: List<KeyHash>,
  redeemers?: Dict<ScriptPurpose, Redeemer>,
  datums?: List<Hash<Blake2b_256, Data>, Data>
}
```

```ts
type Redeemer = 
  | { type: RedeemerType.Data, redeemer: string }
  | { type: RedeemerType.Secret, redeemer: SecretId }
  | { type: RedeemerType.Signature, redeemer: [DataSpec, Primitive] };

enum RedeemerType {
  Data = 1,
  Secret = 2,
  Signature = 3,
}

type DataSpec = string;
type Primitive = string;
```

#### ValidityRange

```ts
type ValidityRange = {
  valid_before?: PosixTime,
  valid_after?: PosixTime,
}
```

#### Value
```ts
type Value = {
    amount: Coin,
    asset: String
}
```

### Aditional Error Types

#### CompletedTxError

```ts
CompletedTxErrorCode = {
	NotFound: 1,
	NotReady: 2
}
```

* NotFound - The transaction with the given id was not found.
* NotReady - The transaction with the given id is not ready yet. 

### V2 Additional API Endpoints

#### `api.cip141.getScriptRequirements`: Promise<ScriptRequirement[]>

Errors: `APIError`

Returns a list of `ScriptRequirement` that will be used to validate any transaction sent to the wallet. Every field in the `ScriptRequirement` object is optional, and the wallet should only include the fields that are relevant to the current transaction.

For wallets with multiple spend conditions, separate entries in the list should be used to represent each spend condition. Wallet providers should implement UX to allow users to order the list of `ScriptRequirement` from most to least preferred. DApps should use the first entry in the list that is valid for the current transaction or select one based on the logic of their use-case.

#### `api.cip141getScript()`: Promise[<number<plutusVersion>>,<CBOR<plutusScript>>]

Errors: `APIError`

Returns the CBOR-encoded Plutus script that controls this wallet.

#### `api.cip141.submitUnsignedTx(tx: CBOR<unsignedTransaction>)`: Promise<hash32>

Errors: `APIError`, `TxError`

Submits a transaction to the wallet for signing. The wallet should check that the transaction is valid, gather the required signatures, compose the finalized transaction, and submit the transaction to the network. If the transaction is valid and the wallet is able to sign it, the wallet should return the transaction hash. If the transaction is invalid or the wallet is unable to sign it, the wallet should throw a `TxError` with the appropriate error code. The wallet should not submit the transaction to the network if it is invalid or the wallet is unable to sign it.

If the transaction contains hidden metadata, the wallet should not submit the transaction when it is ready, but return it to the DApp when the DApp calls the `getCompletedTx` function.

It is expected that this will be the endpoint used by all wallets that require multiple signatures to sign a transaction.

#### `api.cip141.getCompletedTx(txId: hash32)`: Promise[<CBOR<transaction>,CBOR<transaction_witness_set>>]

Errors: `APIError`, `CompletedTxError`

If the transaction is not ready, the wallet should throw a `CompletedTxError` with the appropriate error code. If the transaction is ready, the wallet should return the CBOR-encoded transaction and the signatures.

#### `api.cip141.getSecret(secretId: String)`: Promise<String>

Errors: `APIError`

Returns the secret associated with the given secretId. The secret should be returned as a hex-encoded string. 

Wallets should request authorization from the user before returning the secret to the DApp.

#### `api.cip141.signRedeemer(data: Data, primitive : encriptionPrimitive  )`: Promise<CBOR<redeemer>>

Errors: `APIError`
Returns the CBOR-encoded redeemer.

### Altered API endpoints

#### `api.signTx(tx: CBOR<transaction>, partialSign: bool = false)`: Promise<CBOR<transaction_witness_set>>

This endpoint will now optionally return an error if the smart Wallet is a multiparty schema and signatures need to be gathered from multiple parties asynchronously.

#### `api.signData(addr: Address, payload: Bytes)`: Promise<DataSignature>

Plutus contracts cannot sign data, only validate transactions. This endpoint will be disabled when connecting to a wallet using this extension.

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?

By altering the API endpoints and adding new ones, we can provide the necessary information for DApps to interact with Plutus wallets. This will allow any developer to integrate smart-wallets into their DApps, while providing a consistent interface for all wallets.

## Path to Active

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The interface is implemented and supported by three different wallet providers.
- [ ] The interface is used by three different DApps to interact with wallet providers. 

### Implementation Plan

- [x] Provide some reference implementation of wallet providers
