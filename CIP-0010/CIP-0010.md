## Abstract

Cardano transaction metadata forces metadata entries to namespace their content using an unsigned integer key. This specification is a registry of which use cases has allocated which number to avoid collisions.

## Terminology

Transaction metadata refers to an optional CBOR object in every transaction since the start of the Shelley era. It is defined as the follow CDDL data structure

```
transaction_metadatum =
    { * transaction_metadatum => transaction_metadatum }
  / [ * transaction_metadatum ]
  / int
  / bytes .size (0..64)
  / text .size (0..64)

transaction_metadatum_label = uint

transaction_metadata =
  { * transaction_metadatum_label => transaction_metadatum }
```

## Motivation

The top level of the transaction metadata CBOR object is a mapping of `transaction_metadatum_label` to the actual metadata where the `transaction_metadatum_label` represents an (ideally unique) key for a metadata use case. This allows enables the following:

1) Fast lookup for nodes to query all transactions containing metadata that uses a specific key
2) Allows a single transaction to include multiple metadata entries for different standards

Creating a registry for `transaction_metadatum_label` values has the following benefit:

1) It makes it easy for developers to know which `transaction_metadatum_label` to use to query their node if looking for transactions that use a standard
2) It makes it easy to avoid collisions with other standards that use transaction metadata

## Specification

These are the registered `transaction_metadatum_label` values

transaction_metadatum_label | description

\* It's best to avoid using `0` or any a similar number like `1` that other people are very likely to use. Prefer instead to generate a random number

Please update the `registry.json` file as well when updating the table above.
