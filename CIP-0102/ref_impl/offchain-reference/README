# Using the CIP-102 Offchain Library

## Importing
The contents of this library are available to be imported from `index.ts` and will eventually be published to a public package manager (or two). I will add instructions here when I do.

In the meantime, you can clone or copy the contents of the `/lib/` folder wherever you need it.

## Direct Use

If you want to interact with the library directly without setting up your own project, you can run the code directly with the mock frontend defined in `scripts/mock-frontend.ts`

### Setup

### Reading Royalties
You can query the royalty information for a given collection with the following query:

`deno task get-royalties [policyId]`

This does not return CIP-27 royalties.

### Minting CIP-102 Compliant NFTs
You can mint a collection with multiple CIP-68 nfts & a royalty policy with

`deno task mint-collection`

Instead of using the command line, this takes its parameters from the `mock_` prefixed consts at the start of the `testTimelockedMint` function in `mock-frontend.ts`.
