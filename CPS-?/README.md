## Abstract

<!-- A short (\~200 word) description of the target goals and the technical obstacles to those goals. -->

## Problem

<!-- A more elaborate description of the problem and its context. This section should explain what motivates the writing of the CPS document. -->

## Use cases

<!-- A concrete set of examples written from a user's perspective, describing what and why they are trying to do. When they exist, this section should give a sense of the current alternatives and highlight why they are not suitable. -->

## Goals

<!-- A list of goals and non-goals a project is pursuing, ranked by importance. These goals should help understand the design space for the solution and what the underlying project is ultimately trying to achieve.

Goals may also contain requirements for the project. For example, they may include anything from a deadline to a budget (in terms of complexity or time) to security concerns.

Finally, goals may also serve as evaluation metrics to assess how good a proposed solution is. -->

## Open Questions

<!-- A set of questions to which any proposed solution should find an answer. Questions should help guide solutions design by highlighting some foreseen vulnerabilities or design flaws. Solutions in the form of CIP should thereby include these questions as part of their 'Rationale' section and provide an argued answer to each. -->

<!-- OPTIONAL SECTIONS: see CIP-9999 > Specification > CPS > Structure table -->
