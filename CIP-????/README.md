## Abstract
This CIP proposes an extension of the current Plutus functions to provide support for the [`keccak256`](https://keccak.team/files/Keccak-submission-3.pdf) hashing algorithm,
primarily to ensure compatibility with Ethereum's cryptographic infrastructure.

## Motivation

The [integration](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/pull/252) of the ECDSA and Schnorr signatures over the secp256k1 curve into Plutus was a significant 
step towards interoperability with Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystems. However, full compatibility is still impossible 
due to the absence of the `keccak256` hashing algorithm in Plutus interpreter, 
which is a fundamental component of Ethereum's cryptographic framework:
- data signing standard [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), 
- `keccak256` is the hashing algorithm underlying Ethereum's ECDSA signatures. 
- EVM heavily [depends](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) on `keccak256` for internal state management

Adding `keccak256` to Plutus would enhance the potential for cross-chain solutions between Cardano and EVM-based blockchains.

## Specification
This proposal aims to introduce a new built-in hash function `keccak_256`.

This function will be developed following the [`keccak256`](https://keccak.team/files/Keccak-submission-3.pdf) specification 
and will utilize the [cryptonite](https://github.com/haskell-crypto/cryptonite/blob/master/Crypto/Hash/Keccak.hs) implementation. 
Since `cryptonite` is already a part of the [`cardano-base`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/blob/master/cardano-crypto-class/src/Cardano/Crypto/Hash/Keccak256.hs), 
this simplifies its integration into Plutus. The cost of the `keccak_256` operation will scale linearly with the length of the message.

More specifically, Plutus will gain the following primitive operation:

* `keccak_256` :: ByteString -> ByteString

The input to this function can be a `ByteString` of arbitrary size, and the output will be a `ByteString` of 32 bytes. 
Note that this function aligns with the format of existing hash functions in Plutus, such as [blake2b_256](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/75267027f157f1312964e7126280920d1245c52d/plutus-core/plutus-core/src/Data/ByteString/Hash.hs#L25)

## Rationale
While the `keccak256` function might be implemented in on-chain scripts, doing so would be computationally unfeasible. 

### Trustworthiness of Implementations
The implementation of `keccak256` is based on the version found in the [cardano-base](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-base/blob/master/cardano-crypto-class/src/Cardano/Crypto/Hash/Keccak256.hs) library.

## Backward Compatibility
The addition of `keccak256` is backward compatible and will not interfere with existing functions within Plutus.

## Path to Active
Upon successful review and evaluation, the `keccak256` function is planned for release in an upcoming update.
