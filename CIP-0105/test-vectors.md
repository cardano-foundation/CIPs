# Test Vector for CIP-0105 compliant with CIP-0129

Here we provide a set of test vectors.

### Scripts

Scripts were constructed according to the following native script templates:

**Script 1:** `all [$vKeyhash, active_from 5001]`

**Script 2:** `any [$vKeyhash, all [active_from 5001, active_until 6001]]`

Where `$vKeyhash` is the Verification key hash aka `{drep_vkh1... | cc_cold_vkh1... | cc_hot_vkh1...}`.
