## Abstract

The Conway Ledger era introduces many new features to Cardano, notably features to support community governance via CIP-1694.
This includes the introduction of the new first class credentials; `drep_credential`, `committee_cold_credential` and `committee_hot_credential`.

We propose a HD wallet key derivation paths for registered DReps and constitutional committee members to deterministically derive keys from which credentials can be generated.
Such keys are to be known as DRep keys, constitutional committee cold keys and constitutional committee hot keys.
Here we define some accompanying tooling standards.

> **Note** this proposal assumes knowledge of the Conway ledger design (see
> [draft ledger specification](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger/blob/d2d37f706b93ae9c63bff0ff3825d349d0bd15df/eras/conway/impl/cddl-files/conway.cddl))
> and
> [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1694/README.md).

## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?

In the Conway ledger era, DRep credentials allow registered DReps to be identified on-chain, in DRep registrations, retirements, votes, and in vote delegations from ada holders.
Whilst constitutional committee members can be recognized by their cold credentials within update committee governance actions, authorize hot credential certificate and resign cold key certificates.
Constitutional committee hot credential can be observed within the authorize hot key certificate and votes.

CIP-1694 terms these DRep credentials as DRep IDs, which are either generated from blake2b-224 hash digests of Ed25519 public keys owned by the DRep, or are script hash-based.
Similarly, both the hot and cold credentials for constitutional committee members can be generated from public key digests or script hashes.

This CIP defines a standard way for wallets to derive DRep and constitutional committee keys.

Since it is best practice to use a single cryptographic key for a single purpose, we opt to keep DRep and committee keys separate from other keys in Cardano.

By adding three paths to the [CIP-1852 | HD (Hierarchy for Deterministic) Wallets for Cardano](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1852/README.md), we create an ecosystem standard for wallets to be able to derive DRep and constitutional committee keys.
This enables DRep and constitutional committee credential restorability from a wallet seed phrase.

Stakeholders for this proposal are wallets that follow the CIP-1852 standard and tool makers wishing to support DReps and or constitutional committee members.
This standard allows DReps and constitutional committee members to use alternative wallets whilst being able to be correctly identified.
By defining tooling standards, we enable greater interoperability between governance-focussed tools.

## Specification

### Derivation

#### DRep Keys

Here we describe DRep key derivation as it pertains to Cardano wallets that follow the CIP-1852 standard.

To differentiate DRep keys from other Cardano keys, we define a new `role` index of `3`:

`m / 1852' / 1815' / account' / 3 / address_index`

We strongly recommend that a maximum of one set of DRep keys should be associated with one wallet account, which can be achieved by setting `address_index=0`.

#### DRep ID

Tools and wallets can generate a DRep ID (`drep_credential`) from the Ed25519 public DRep key (without chaincode) by creating a blake2b-224 hash digest of the key.
As this is key-based credential it should be marked as entry `0` in a credential array.

#### Constitutional Committee Cold Keys

Here we describe constitutional committee cold key derivation as it pertains to Cardano wallets that follow the CIP-1852 standard.

To differentiate constitutional committee cold keys from other Cardano keys, we define a new `role` index of `4`:

`m / 1852' / 1815' / account' / 4 / address_index`

We strongly recommend that a maximum of one set of constitutional committee cold keys should be associated with one wallet account, which can be achieved by setting `address_index=0`.

#### Constitutional Committee Cold Credential

Tools and wallets can generate a constitutional committee cold credential (`committee_cold_credential`) from the Ed25519 public constitutional committee cold key (without chaincode) by creating a blake2b-224 hash digest of the key.
As this is key-based credential it should be marked as entry `0` in a credential array.

#### Constitutional Committee Hot Keys

Here we describe constitutional committee hot key derivation as it pertains to Cardano wallets that follow the CIP-1852 standard.

To differentiate constitutional committee hot keys from other Cardano keys, we define a new `role` index of `5`:

`m / 1852' / 1815' / account' / 5 / address_index`

We strongly recommend that a maximum of one set of constitutional committee hot keys should be associated with one wallet account, which can be achieved by setting `address_index=0`.

#### Constitutional Committee Hot Credential

Tools and wallets can generate a constitutional committee hot credential (`committee_hot_credential`) from the Ed25519 public constitutional committee hot key (without chaincode) by creating a blake2b-224 hash digest of the key.
As this is key-based credential it should be marked as entry `0` in a credential array.

### Bech32 Encoding

### Versioning

This CIP is not to be versioned using a traditional scheme, rather if any large technical changes are required then a new proposal must replace this one.
Small changes can be made if they are completely backwards compatible with implementations, but this should be avoided.

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?

### Derivation

By standardizing derivation, naming, and tooling conventions we primarily aim to enable wallet interoperability.
By having a standard to generate DRep and constitutional committee credentials from mnemonics, we allow wallets to always be able to discover a user’s governance activities.

#### Why add a new roles to the 1852 path?

This approach mirrors how stake keys were rolled out, see [CIP-0011 | Staking key chain for HD wallets](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0011/README.md).
We deem this necessary since these credentials sit alongside each other in the Conway ledger design.

The alternative would be to define a completely different derivation paths, using a different index in the purpose field, similar to the specification outlined within [CIP-0036](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0036/README.md#derivation-path), but this could introduce complications with HW wallet implementations.

#### Why not multi-DRep/CC wallet accounts?

We believe the overhead that would be introduced by multi-DRep accounts or multi-constitutional-committee is an unjustified expense.
Future iterations of this specification may expand on this, but at present this is seen as unnecessary.
This avoids the need for DRep, cc hot or cc cold key discovery.

We model this on how stake keys are generally handled by wallets.
If required, another CIP could, of course, introduce a multi-DRep/CC method.

### Encoding

#### Why not allow network tags?

For simplicity, we have omitted network tags within the encoding.
This is because we have modeled DRep IDs and CC credentials on stake pool operator IDs, which similarly do not include a network tag.

The advantage of including a network tag would be to reduce the likelihood of mislabelling a DRep’s network of operation (eg Preview v Cardano mainnet).

## Path to Active
