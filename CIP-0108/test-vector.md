# Test Vector for CIP-0108

Here we create some useful definitions and some examples.

## Common Context

### Common Fields

The context fields which could be added to CIP-108 compliant jsonld files.
See [cip-0108.common.jsonld](./cip-0108.common.jsonld).

### Common Fields Schema

A json schema for the common context fields.
See [cip-0108.common.schema.json](./cip-0108.common.schema.json).

## Examples

### Treasury Withdrawal

Example metadata document file: [treasury-withdrawal.jsonld](./examples/treasury-withdrawal.jsonld).

#### Intermediate files

Files produced to articulate process, these are not necessary in implementations.

## How-to Recreate Examples

This tutorial creates additional intermediate files, these are not required in implementations but are shown here to articulate the process.

### Author

Keys used for author property, provided here for convenience.

Private extended signing key (hex): `105d2ef2192150655a926bca9cccf5e2f6e496efa9580508192e1f4a790e6f53de06529129511d1cacb0664bcf04853fdc0055a47cc6d2c6d205127020760652`

Public verification key (hex):
`7ea09a34aebb13c9841c71397b1cabfec5ddf950405293dee496cac2f437480a`


Public verification key hash (hex): `0fdc780023d8be7c9ff3a6bdc0d8d3b263bd0cc12448c40948efbf42`

Mainnet public enterprize address (hex):
`610fdc780023d8be7c9ff3a6bdc0d8d3b263bd0cc12448c40948efbf42`

### 1. Create the example.jsonld's `body`

Create the `example.jsonld` file adding in all available values.
Then remove from this document any top-level field that is not `@context` or `body`.

If recreating the [Treasury Withdrawal](#treasury-withdrawal), this will result in the intermediate file of [treasury-withdrawal.body.jsonld](./examples/treasury-withdrawal.body.jsonld).

### 2. Canonicalize the `body`

Using a tool which complies with the [RDF Dataset Canonicalization](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/rdf-dataset-canonicalization/spec/), create a canonicalized representation of `example.body.jsonld`.
One such tool is the [JSON-LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/).
Ensure the results ends in a newline.

This creates `example.body.nq`.

For [Treasury Withdrawal](#treasury-withdrawal), this will result in the intermediate file of [treasury-withdrawal.body.nq](./examples/treasury-withdrawal.body.nq).

### 3. Hash the canonicalized `body`

Using a tool create a Blake2b-256 hash of the canonicalized `example.body.nq`.
One such tool is the [ToolKit Bay](https://toolkitbay.com/tkb/tool/BLAKE2b_256).

For [Treasury Withdrawal](#treasury-withdrawal), this will result in: `68d6fe27087457acf0164e65414238c43573192c99f30341926d1524924d71ca`.

### 4. Authors witness over the hash of canonicalized `body`

Use the hash produced in [3.](#3-hash-the-canonicalized-body) as the payload for the witnessing. For a `witnessAlgorithm` of `ed25519` refer to [CIP-100 Hashing and Signatures](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0100/README.md#hashing-and-signatures), for `cip-0008` refer to [CIP-108 New Witness Type](./README.md#new-witness-type).

For [Treasury Withdrawal](#treasury-withdrawal), we use the keys described in [Author](#author) resulting in: `a476985b4cc0d457f247797611799a6f6a80fc8cb7ec9dcb5a8223888d0618e30de165f3d869c4a0d9107d8a5b612ad7c5e42441907f5b91796f0d7187d64a01`.

### 5. Add other properties to example.jsonld

We can go back to our `example.body.jsonld` and now add in all missing properties, from outside of `body`.
- Adding the `hashAlgorithm` of `blake2b-256`.
- Adding the `authors` with a single entry, including information of our `witness` goes into the `signature`.

By adding this information we create our `example.jsonld`.

For [Treasury Withdrawal](#treasury-withdrawal), this will result in [treasury-withdrawal.jsonld](./examples/treasury-withdrawal.jsonld).

### 6. Hash example.jsonld

To be able to create a final metadata hash which can be attached on-chain we  we simply hash the content of the file [Treasury Withdrawal](#treasury-withdrawal.jsonld) as is.

This results is: `311b148ca792007a3b1fee75a8698165911e306c3bc2afef6cf0145ecc7d03d4`.

### 7. Submit to chain

We can then host `example.jsonld` somewhere easily accessible following [CIP-100 Best Practices](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0100/README.md#best-practices).

Then at submission time of the governance metadata anchor we can provide the on-chain transaction both the URI to the hosted `example.jsonld` but also the hash generated via [6.](#6-Hash-examplejsonld).
