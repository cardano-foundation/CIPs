## Abstract

As a blockchain ecosystem, Cardano is not only an immutable ledger of data but
also a cooperative network of individuals and organizations engaged in economic
collaboration, social impact, decentralized decision-making, and technological
development. Therefore, Cardano's governance system cannot be limited to the
source code of the software and on-chain effects of transactions but also must
guide the interactions of individuals and organizations who choose to interact
within the network.

## Problem

The Cardano Community is in need of guidance and procedures for dealing with
governance issues. The Cardano Constitution is one document that helps
adjudicate such issues. The Constitutional Committee - one of the three bodies
designated in the Cardano Governance System - is bound to uphold this document
when voting on the passage of Governance Actions.

However, there are some issues or practices which the Constitution does not
speak to or which might not be best addressed by the Constitution. This is
particularly true for best practices which are recommended but not strictly
required or governance procedures that necessitate details that may need to be
updated apart from the rest of the Constitution text.

## Use cases

Several example use cases can already be identified between ongoing social
discussions, community workshops, and the text of the Interim and Draft Cardano
Constitutions themselves.

### Code(s) of Conduct

DReps and other governance actors should have a template they may use to develop
a Code of Conduct that they plan to share with the Cardano Community as a way to
self-regulate and make transparent their governance philosophy.

### Budget Process

While the Cardano Constitution requires that Treasury withdrawals must not be
ratified until there is a community-approved Cardano budget then in effect
pursuant to a previous on-chain governance action agreed by the DReps with a
threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake, there is no standard
set for what that Budget process should look like. A Budget Process Template
should be created to guide this activity.

### Constitutional Committee Election/Selection Process

While the Cardano Governance Parameters establish the minimal Constitutional
Committee size and Minimum and Maximum term length (in epochs) for
Constitutional Committee members, the Constitution does not establish how these
members are elected beyond requiring a vote of the DReps. A Constitutional
Committee Selection Process should be created to guide this activity.

## Goals

There are many areas where Cardano Governance practices may become standardized
through custom or habit. When appropriate, these processes should be
standardized as a CIP in the Governance category to create a transparent
template for the Cardano Community to follow.

One of the primary goals of this CPS (and subsequent CIPs) is to define a
location and process for the community to suggest, deliberate, and adopt
governance-related customs and habits in a formally documented and easy to
locate and aggregate fashion without relying strictly on Constitution changes
directly.
