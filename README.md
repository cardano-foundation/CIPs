# Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs)

Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards, processes; or provide general guidelines or information to the Cardano Community. It is a formal, technical communication process that exists off-chain. 
The current process, as CIP1, is in Draft status and likely to change as the CIP editors add final elements. Feedback/concerns/suggestions are welcome, through traditional channels or the issues tab.
  

Discuss ‘ideas’ about CIPs on the [Developer Forums](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cips/122), Cardano’s Official [Developer Telegram Group](https://t.me/CardanoDevelopersOfficial) or in #developers in Cardano Ambassadors Slack.
