# Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs)

Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards, processes; or provide general guidelines or information to the Cardano Community. It is a formal, technical communication process that exists off-chain. 
The current process is described in details in [CIP1 - "CIP Process"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP1/CIP1.md).  

 Feedback/concerns/suggestions welcome, through regular channels or the issues tab. 
  

Extend or discuss ‘ideas’ in the [Developer Forums](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/cips/122), Cardano’s Official [Developer Telegram Group](https://t.me/CardanoDevelopersOfficial) or in #developers in Cardano Ambassadors Slack.
