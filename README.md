# Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs)

Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards, processes; or provide general guidelines or information to the Cardano Community. It is a formal, technical communication process that exists off-chain. 
The current process is described in details in [CIP1 - "CIP Process"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP1/CIP1.md).
