## Abstract <!-- A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed and the proposed solution -->

## Motivation <!-- A clear and short explanation introducing the reason behind a proposal. When changing an established design, it must outlines issues in the design that motivates a rework. -->

## Specification <!-- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations. -->

## Rationale <!-- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion. When applicable, it must also explain how the proposal affects backward-compatibility of existing solutions. -->

## Path to Active <!-- A reference implementation, observable metrics or anything showing the acceptance of the proposal in the community. It must be completed before any CIP is given status “Active”, but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. It acts as a high-level roadmap for the proposal. -->
