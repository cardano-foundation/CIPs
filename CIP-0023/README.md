## Abstract

This proposes to create a more fair marketplace for stakepools by reducing the minimum fixed pool fee and adding a minimum variable pool fee.

## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?

The current minimum fixed pool fee places a large and unfair burden on delegators to pools with smaller amounts of stake.
This incentivizes people to delegate to pools with higher stake causing centralization and creating an unequal playing field for stakepool operators.

Reducing the minimum fixed pool fee and adding a minimum variable pool fee reduces the imbalance between stakepools with less or more stake to a more reasonable range that allows for more fair competition between stakepools and more fair rewards for delegators to stakepools with less stake.

This creates a more fair marketplace for all stakepool operators and increases decentralization, which is a goal of Cardano.

## Specification

This CIP introduces a new protocol parameter, `minMargin`, which represents the
minimum variable fee (margin) that a stake pool can set. This parameter is
distinct from the existing `minPoolCost`, which represents the minimum fixed
fee a pool can set. Both limits are enforced independently by the ledger.

- `minMargin` defines the lower bound for the pool margin (variable fee), i.e.,
  the minimum allowable percentage of rewards a pool can take. Pool
  registration and update certificates MUST have `margin >= minMargin`.
- `minPoolCost` retains its current meaning and enforcement as the minimum
  fixed fee a pool can set.

This CIP does not prescribe specific values for either parameter. Concrete
values for `minMargin` and `minPoolCost` are to be chosen and enacted through
the standard protocol parameter update process.

### Backward Compatibility

There are 2 ways to handle the existing pool certificates with minimum variable pool fee less than the proposed value:
1. These pool certificates would be treated as if they had the new mimimum variable pool fee.
2. These pool certificates would be invalid and pool operators would be required to create new certificates with valid values.    
If option 1 is possible, it would provide a better user experience for both stakepool operators and delegators and would cause less disruption to the network.

## Rationale: how does this CIP achieve its goals?

The PHP code in minfees.php in the pull request allows exploration of the effects of choosing different values for the minimum fixed and variable fees.
Running minfees without any arguments gives the usage message as below.

```
php minfees.php

Usage: php minfees.php <min_fixed_fee> <min_rate_fee> <pledge>
  min_fixed_fee:  Minimum fixed fee in ADA.
               An integer greater than or equal to 0.
  min_rate_fee: Minimum rate fee in decimal. Example: 1.5% = .015
                    A real number greater than or equal to 0.
  pledge: Optional pledge amount in ADA. Defaults to 100000
                    A real number greater than or equal to 0.
```

Running minfees with the proposed values gives the following comparison of current and proposed pool operator and staker results at various pool stake levels.

Definitions:
Pool Stake - Total stake delegated to pool.
Total Rewards - Total rewards generated by the pool in one epoch.
Pool Cur Fee - The total amount of fees taken by the pool with current parameters.
Staker Cur Fee - The amount of fees paid by a staker who delegates 100k ADA  with current parameters.
Staker Cur Rew - The amount of rewards received by a staker who delegates 100k ADA  with current parameters.
Current Fee % - The percentage of rewards taken by the pool as fees  with current parameters.
Pool New Fee - The total amount of fees taken by the pool with proposed parameters.
Staker New Fee - The amount of fees paid by a staker who delegates 100k ADA with proposed parameters.
Staker New Rew - The amount of rewards received by a staker who delegates 100k ADA with proposed parameters.
New Fee % - The percentage of rewards taken by the pool as fees with proposed parameters.
Note: All amounts other than %s are in ADA.

The table above shows that currently a delegator staking 100k ADA to a stakepool with 2m ADA total delegation to the pool is paying an exorbitant 22.7% in fees while the same delegator staking with a fully saturated pool would only pay 0.7% in fees.
This is a substantial and unfair advantage that large pools have in the stakepool marketplace.
This is a strong incentive to centralize stake to fewer larger pools which reduces the resiliency of the network.

The proposed minimum fees bring this imbalance into a more reasonable range of 1.6% to 4.8%.
It is much more likely that a small stakepool with other advantages or selling points would be able to convince a delegator to accept about 2 less ADA in rewards per epoch for their 100k delegation than about 17 ADA as in the current case.
This is particularly true as the price of ADA increases.
At current price of $0.90 USD, a delegator staking 100k ADA is giving up over $1000 USD per year by delegating to a small pool!
This does not even include the amount lost by comounding rewards being staked over the year.

16.5 ADA/epoch * 73 epochs/year =  1204.5 ADA/year
1204.5 ADA/year * $0.90 USD/ADA = $1084.05 USD/year

With proposed parameters the same delegator would only be giving up about $150 USD per year to support a small pool.

2.3 ADA/epoch * 73 epochs/year =  167.9 ADA/year
167.9 ADA/year * $0.90 USD/ADA = $151.11 USD/year

The calculations below show that given the price increase in ADA compared to when the protocol parameters were first set, we can maintain viable funding for stakepool operators with the proposed parameter changes.

Annual pool operator funding given initial parameters:
340 ADA/epoch * $0.08 USD/ADA = $27.20 USD/epoch
$27.20 USD/epoch * 73 epochs/year = $1985.60 USD/year

Annual pool operator funding given proposed parameters for stakepool with 2 million ADA delegation:
71.8 ADA/epoch * $0.90 USD/ADA = $64.62 USD/epoch
$64.62 USD/epoch * 73 epochs/year = $4717.26 USD/year

Annual pool operator funding given proposed parameters for fully saturated stakepool:
769.6 ADA/epoch * $0.90 USD/ADA = $692.64 USD/epoch
$692.64 USD/epoch * 73 epochs/year = $50,562.72 USD/year

In summary, the proposed parameter changes would create a more fair marketplace for stakepools, provide more fair rewards for delegators to smaller pools and would lower incentives for centralization providing a more resilient network.

### Test Cases

See the minfees.php code to test different potential values of the parameters.

## Path to Active

### Acceptance Criteria

- CIP Editor Approval – Cardano CIP Editors must confirm that the specification is complete, unambiguous, and internally consistent with existing CIPs.
- Consensus on initial parameter value – An initial value for the new protocol parameter `minMargin` must be agreed upon before hard-fork combinator (HFC) activation. The choice should consider operational viability, empirical analyses, and community feedback.
- Endorsement by Technical Bodies – The Cardano Parameter-Change Proposals (PCP) Committee and the Intersect Technical Steering Committee (TSC) should both recommend the proposal as technically sound and aligned with the protocol’s long-term roadmap.
- Stakeholder Concurrence – A majority of stake pool operators (SPOs), ecosystem tooling maintainers, dReps, and other infrastructure providers must signal readiness to upgrade.
- Governance Ratification – The on-chain Hard-Fork Governance Action must pass the requisite dRep and Constitutional Committee thresholds, establishing legal-constitutional legitimacy and stakeholder support for the change.

### Implementation Plan

- Community Deliberation (Preparation Phase)
  - Publish the finalized CIP revision and present it to the PCP committee, TSC, CIP Editors, and wider community channels (Discord, X, Cardano Forum, etc.).
  - Collect structured feedback, particularly on candidate values for the new parameter values and iterate until broad technical consensus emerges.
- Specification & Code Integration (Development Phase)
  - Once initial parameter values are determined, integrate the new rewards calculation logic and governance features for the new parameter into cardano-node and related libraries (ledger, CLI, wallet APIs).
  - Determine the best method to deal with existing pool registration certificates that currently have a variable fee lower than what the new `minMargin` parameter allows.
  - Submit pull requests to the canonical repositories; obtain code reviews from IOG, CF, and community contributors.
  - Release a new protocol version that includes the changes made in this CIP.
  - Use a dedicated pre-production testnet that mirrors main-net parameters but enforces the new changes, allowing SPOs and exchanges to test end-to-end flows.
- Readiness Sign-off (Testing Phase)
  - Require at least two weeks of uninterrupted testnet stability plus green results from regression and property-based tests.
  - Monitor ecosystem dApps and tooling to confirm that major node implementations, explorers, wallets, and exchange integrations support the new rule set.
- On-chain Governance (Ratification Phase)
  - File the Hard-Fork Governance Action on-chain with the agreed initial parameter value tagged for the next hard fork event.
  - Modify the existing Cardano Constitution to include definitions and guardrails for the new protocol parameters and have it ratified by the tripartite government of Cardano.
  - Mobilize dRep outreach to ensure quorum and super-majority passage; concurrently, the Constitutional Committee validates procedural compliance.
- Hard-Fork Activation (Deployment Phase)
  - Upon successful vote, the hard fork event is automatically triggered upon epoch turnover.
  - Monitor main-net metrics during the changeover epoch; provide real-time support for any late-upgrading SPOs.
