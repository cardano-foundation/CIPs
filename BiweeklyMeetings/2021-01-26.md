## Summary

Rough writeup of 01/26/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.


## January 26 2021 notes 
**Attending Editors**: ~Matthias~, Sebastien, Duncan, Frederic.  

### Triage  
N/A

### Last Check  
#### Extended Metadata  
([PR15](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) - potential CIP-0006)    
**Frederic** - No update from Markus - leaving as-is, reaching out to Markus.  
=> Ping @Gufmar to address final tweaks on Github. Functionally on hold. 

#### Cardano Parameters   
([PR45](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/45) - potential CIP-0009)   
**Frederic** - Ready to go but missing some structure. Consensus was this is ready to be merged.   
**Duncan** - If it's simply the header, we should add this in and merge it. You can see the template for it, he added and removed it.  
**Sebastien** - Ok to merge by me.  
**D** - Remind the Catalyst group that this is not the PR for "proposing" but the informational one for updating. New CIPs for proposing parameter changes must be separate CIPs - conflicting CIPs can exist, but this should be the informational one.  
**F** - What about the case where a parameter change happens but this CIP does not get updated?  
**D** - Anyone would be able to come and push a PR with the appropriate change to update this.  
=> **MERGING** pending internal discussion re: status.    

#### HD Stake Pool Cold Keys  
([PR56](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/56) - potential CIP-1853)  
**S** - We requested changes last time.   
**D** - There is a patch since last comments that we added - Last meeting we were looking at Hardened vs. non-hardened. Our conclusion was that the usecase fields should all be hardened: Now they are all hardened.   
**S** - Approving.   
=> **MERGING** now  



### Review  

#### Catalyst Registration transaction metadata format   
([PR58](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/58) - potential CIP-0014)   
**S** - This one is missing a CIP number but it's already deployed on mainnet. If someone wants to change working, this is already deployed. No opposition on wording tweaks.  
**D** - Did anyone else reviewed this and double checked the description corresponds to reality?  
**S** - No. This is just documenting what the Fund2 used 'in practice'. There were some test vectors and ideas but no formal writeup.   
**D** - Can we get someone from Catalyst to review the CIP?   
**S** - I'll ping on the topic and see. I also posted it in the Catalyst Slack channel as well.  
=> to Last Check (to be merged next meeting) 

#### Update to CIP-0013   
([PR61](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/61) - Update to CIP-0013)   
**Sebastien** - You may remember a while back we had that URI scheme and Robert wanted to add the support to create staking pool delegation through the URI scheme. We decided to setup what we had first, for the payment, but now this is adding another scheme. We want this so external websites can create URI links, that open accordingingly where they should. Since this is fairly related to the payment scheme, this should be bundled here, and might even later be expanded. This provides a source of truth that others can refer to.  
**Robert** - The formal grammar was reworked, added another authority for doubleslash spent, (there was also a discussion for metadata, the URI could be further extended), we'd want the protocol to evolve, this PR is just for single pools to be added to the CIP itself.  
**D** - Why is it that we want to custom URL schemes rather than a MIME type?  
**S** - Yoroi is a browser extension. Whenever you select such a URL it'd open Yoroi (or Deadalus) appropriately..    
**D** - Browsers have for decades been dealing with application associating with MIME types. This is my first time I see custom URI scheme - yet am not a web-dev. Presumably this works for mobile phones also. Is this common practive? 
**S** - It used to be more contractors like mailto: and so on. Back then we could embed skype links etc. But it got too complicated and they created a whitelist of URI prefixes and not being on the list is no bueno. The recommended approach is to use an existing prefix which is why the URI scheme starts with 'Web+Cardano'- they still let you do it but in the namespace. Bitcoin (because it was created a while ago) managed to make it to the whitelist because it was created a while ago.  
**D** - They still encourage you to do this rather than file + MIME types?  
**S** - As far as I know. Have never seen MIME types used rather than this anywhere.   
**D** - The QR codes?   
**R** - QR codes are just enconding of URLs   
**S** - Chrome has poor support for this but Firefox had. Unfortunately Chrome is winning the browser war. The support for the APIs are the bare minimum for the browser extensions / functionality to work, while Firefox has better thought out support. The only people that recommend specific setups are mobile apps, such as registering directly with your App: Instead of using a URI scheme, they link to a specific page and you have that specific page register with your app to check if it is installed, and if installed open the app...  
**D** - Thanks for the digging into things.   
**R** - This was explored in the closed [PR25](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/61) - Sebastien had answered it there. I'm a webdev, I integrate with websites and whatnot. Some schemes are more popular than the community realizes because of torrents and others... At least knowing we can rely on URI consistently would give the SPOs and end users at least one consistent option that is well supported.  
**D** - One more Q: Can you use a combination of MIME/URI?  
**S** - You cannot. It's not possible.   
**D** - Why do we allow pool tickers given they aren't unique rather than their IDs?  
**S** - The rationale is to accomodate for pool operators that have multiple pools with a common prefix. So they may want to have a URI to the common prefix and the wallet would be in charge of managing it.  
=> to Last Check (to be merged next meeting) 

#### Update to CIP-0010    
([PR62](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/62) - Update to CIP-0010)    
**F** - This is an update to the registry entry - not sure what this does.  
**D** - It sounds like he wants CIP-0010 using a machine-readable format (on top of the existing human-readable format). He's given examples and a schema for how it should be added and implicitely the registry should fit that schema.  
**S** - This seem to make sense in theory. Slightly concerned that these two (formats) will not sync up and we'll run into issues with one no longer matching the other? If we were to only pick one I would pick the machine-readable format and would avoid having both.  
**D** - Avoiding duplication typically sensible.  
=> Move to REVIEW for next meeting + reaching out to Author (Marek).  

#### Key Serialization formats    
([PR57](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/57) - potential CIP-xxxx)   
**S** - Have not been able to review.  
**D** - I've not properly reviewed yet. The intention here is to complement the prefixes CIP - this one here would be looking at the format of those keys for historical reference and documentation: This CIP is intent on describing what the FORMAT of keys is about - due to historical complexity and so no. That's from the 3 types of keys. Edd25519 keys, ordinary verification and signing keys, also the Jormagandr "extended keys" and later the "BIP32" keys. (One of those format should never have existed but Jormagandr added it anyways).  
**S** - There is a good [Forum post](https://forum.cardano.org/t/message-signing-specification/41032/5) describing things, and it lists 4 formats.   
**D** - We should be careful reviewing this, should flag to Matthias. The two recommended forms, and also for historical reasons the other ones still used by the older tools, intended to be never be used yet used as extended version by some tools... but not recommended to use. We should probably take this CIP over from here, this should be a good starting Draft.  
=> Move to REVIEW for next meeting.  



### Discussions  
**D** - [PR55](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/55) looks like it's simple / ready to go and should be merged.  
**S** - Let's merge it. (=> merging)  
**F** - Mentions about using Tags in the repo if anyone has preference. Also regarding publicizing those meetings.  
**D** - Also let's add [PR31](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/31) to next meeting. Looks ready to be merged even.  
**R** - [PR61](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/61) has 2 reviews, but 1 of those isn't from an editor, are we awaiting for some other kind of review?  
**D** - Correct, awaiting another Editor review. Will look into [PR61](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/61) and give it the green tick for next meeting.  


### Close  
**On Hold** “Curve proposal” (‘CIP7’) still awaiting legal followup    
**On Hold** [PR15 - “Extended Metadata”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) (tentative ‘CIP-0006’) - expecting last tweaks.
