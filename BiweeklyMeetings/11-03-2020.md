## Summary

Rough writeup of 11/3/20 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.

### Review  

#### Extended Metadata  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) - potential CIP6)   
**F** - Last we looked at this CIP, the ask was for comments/feedback from major pools. Cardanians replied two weeks ago.   
**S** - Some parts we're still unsure re: security model - the RSS feel might not have been fully thought through. I think issues might have been addressed since.  
**M** - sorry was busy past month. I have some tech Q: what do we need to do with what is already existing from the CLI to generate an additional key? That key could be generated so the extended metadata can be verified, so Yoroi/Daedalus can accept the metadata.  
**D** - Are you talking about a first level metadata contains a keyhash and a URL (to the secondary metadata level)?  
**M** - Yes, to be more flexible for the 2nd level: no codekey to update the (2nd level) extended metadata but with some hash or verification mechanism. So that means another key should be generated (am against too many hashes onchain).  
**D** - We extend the first/primary level metadata with two extra fields: One is the PubKeyhash (that will be used to sign the 2nd level metadata) and the URL of where to find the 2nd level MD. The 2nd level MD is found at URL, and there is some signature that accompanies it (signed/verifiable against 1st lvl keyhash). If that is the case, you can change the 2nd level metadata without re-registering the pool. And also update the 1st level metadata without having to change the key for the 2nd level metadata.  
**M** - Right now we have a hash onchain of the prime metadata. I want to summarize fields so the proposal can start with "the minimum metadata". What I mean to summarize is that this CIP should contain a proposal for what "future extended metadata should look like" and I need your feedback on key types to use etc.  
**D** - Ordinary ed25519 key is the simplest thing to do.  
**M** - Need more time from Mike also - and need some feedback from other groups to weigh in - there wasn't much feedback unfortunately. This is a fairly easy and non-technical CIP.  
**D** - Focus on the details of the mechanism, but also what the exact format of the witness/signature.  
**M** - I'll try it out and seek your feedback in the PR through comments.  
**Matthias** - For signature, go with simplest: if that's embedded, or on the side.. We don't want to complicate things.  
**M** - From operative pt of view, if SPO wants to integrate, it should be straightforward.  
**D** - Two files ok?   
**M** - yes - because when ext-metadata file is updated then would need to do other file (signature).   
**D** - The CLI would validate the json and generate the signature for you... But still two files you host.  
**M** - Yes, some external tool / CMS whatever SPO has, can generate the new extended metadata file and you send it to the CLI, which creates the signature of the new extended metadata file. Probably need two URL fields in 1st level. Mike's feedback originally was that he didn't want to update base URL in .json.  
**D** - ok maybe two URL.  
=> On Hold, Markus to add comments to which Duncan will follow up in the PR regarding scheme.  

#### Wallet key generation  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/3)  - potential CIP3)  
**S** - Added test vectors and took comments on the PR. A Fairly small CIP, bulk of is the Test Vectors. I got them from Matthias and some independantly tested on the Yoroi codebase. No problems with Keygen.  
**M** - I intended to review and approve last week, thanks for the TVs - no issues. This is an excerpt of a diff doc we reviewed as a team - used to be part of Adrestia userguide/docs. The masterkey gen was extracted from the docs into this CIP..   
**S** - This comes from the Adrestia docs and Trezor documentation and I added extra about the passphrase feature... Also added the passphraze feature for Ledger which wasn't in the docs. When creating via Trezor and selecting the 24 word option it uses a diff alg that nobody knows of (Matthias: "yet").  
**D** - Fine if you both approve this.  
**M** - All the new wallets are using the Icarus version, the more prevalent standard - I propose we add that to this CIP that for new applications we recommend this version. (agreement).   
=> Merge in two weeks  


#### HD Wallet for Cardano  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/27) - potential CIP1852)  
**S** - This one has a lot of history behind it - we had to represent that new staking key and needed it to be deterministic so Yoroi and Daedalus had to have the same staking key. The easiest way is to just derive it from the Master key so we added a new chain derivation. We added a chain derivation we added a 2-chain & called it "Chimeric account" which came from jormungandr (due to originally keys were the same). We could rename it for "staking key chain"...   
**M** - We just started calling it "Roles". We also use it for the multisig key. I would push we publish this CIP very soon.  
**D** - I think that's most sensible terminology..  
**M** - Catalyst team decided to have complely different HD tree, so completely diff mnemonic - the rationale is that the voting wallet should be completely separate and independant from the voting wallet...  
**S** - Bad idea likely but we can discuss some other time. I'll rewrite the CIP. Do you want every new role we add to be a separate CIP?  
**M** - I would prefer one explaining the general naming, and then individual CIPs for new roles we add. But open to doing PR to that one CIP also for reference... Can do the same as we for Metadata Registry.  
**S** - I'll split this CIP in two parts then (a CIP for allocating numbers and a separate CIP for the specific role itself)  
=> ON hold, Sebastien to split into two  


#### Transaction Metadata Registry  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/34) - potential CIP10)  
**S** - Every Tx in Cardano contains Tx Metadata, stored as a map of unsigned numbers to CBOR. We can use this map as a namespace, but to have it be as an effective namespace we need some sort of registry where people can document what number they are using for what purposes, and/or define possibly reserved/specific ranges.  
**S** - The SPOCRA ppl already started metadata and have 200-300 Tx on mainnet. They will probably be the first to allocate numbers...  
**D** - Let's setup a private range now. Start with '0'. We should be explicit... ex 0-255: 'reserved'. We should have a small and large reserve range. Proposing we go with [0-15] - (agreement). Also [2^16 to 2^17 - 1] for private use, so that guaranteed not to clash with interoperable ones.  
=> Merge **NOW** (as other CIPs will depend on this / need the draft).  

#### Cardano URI Scheme  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/30) - potential CIP)  
**S** - We will need to change and merge two CIPs together. Moving on.  

#### Treasury Fraction on actual distributed rewards  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/35) - potential CIP)  
**S** - This was on the agenda so we can get Duncan's take on who should be involved.  
**D** - Lars Brunje. He'll direct through the right teams review and provide feedback.  



### Discussions  
**F** - Crowdcast issues. Will follow-up and attempt to resolve for next meeting.  



### Close  
**ON Hold** “Curve proposal” (‘CIP7’) still awaiting legal followup  
**ON Hold** [“Extended Metadata”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) (potential ‘CIP6’) - extend conversation in PR.  
**ON Hold** [“HD Wallet for Cardano”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/27) (potential ‘CIP1852’) - to be split into two PRs by Sebastien  
**ON Hold** [“Treasury”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/35) (potential CIP) - Requesting feedback and review from scientists  
=> Merge in two weeks: [“Wallet key generation”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/3) to be merged as ‘Draft’ (‘CIP3’)    
=> Merge **NOW**: [“Metadata Registry”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/34)to be merged as ‘Draft’ (‘CIP10’)
