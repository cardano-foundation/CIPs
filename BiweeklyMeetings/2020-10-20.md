## Summary

Rough writeup of 10/20/20 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.



## October 20 2020 notes


**Attending**: (Duncan, Frederic, Matthias, Sebastien) + Ben (IO)


### Triage
N/A

### Last Check  

#### Extended Metadata  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) - potential CIP6)   

**Frederic** “Extended Metadata” has there been updates? Appears this is still on hold -  let's wait another two weeks, authors were absent and outreach for info needed.  
**Duncan** We should open it up to more people: maybe someone else might want to take it over?Let's not push it if there isn't interest.  
**Sebastien** We're waiting for info on explorers.  
**Duncan** As long as the authors are still engaged, that's fine.  
**Sebastien** ADApools is the one who setup an extended metadata format (the format the CIP is based on): we wanted their feedback on this proposal.  
**Frederic** Will Follow on. Ping them directly or invite them + authors.  
=> **On Hold**  


#### Wallet Checksum  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/4)  - potential CIP4)  

**Frederic** all good to go - (no objections).   



### Review  

#### Message Signing  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/27) - potential CIP8)  
**Duncan** Good feedback from IOG.   
**Sebastien** Voltaire voting is coming up, I would like for it to be merged now (as it was discussed on the last call).  
**Frederic** We're working in the context of "CIPs are a set of tools that implementers can pick and choose as they want" and it seems IOG might consider CIP to be canon for the main protocol.. CH brought up CRCs ("Cardano Request for Comments" - open discussion towards Cardano standards) - we touched to those in the past and at the time we agreed on proceeding with CIPs being non-restrictive.  
**Duncan** All things being equal, it's preferable to have one general guideline rather than three because of interoperability. Mild preference for a single standard for message signing. We lightly discussed merging this now last meeting, let's proceed.  
=> **MERGING** now




### Discussions 

**Duncan** Suggest we move CIP5 into "Proposed" state, and require details of the plan while it's in "Proposed" state?  
**Frederic** "Proposed" must have defined metrics of acceptance/plan to Active.  
**Frederic**  Propose we keep every 10 meetings as small (agreement). Propose we try out Crowdcast for next meeting. Need a Pr to fix numbering issues and links.   
**Duncan** We also need a better chart or table at top-level: a readme would be helpful...  
**Frederic** the (CIP auto gen site) is being managed by IOG; slow to get issues fixed unfortunately 




### Close
 
**On Hold** Change Format of CIPs (in CIP1) (instead CIPx.md)  
**ON Hold** “Curve proposal” (‘CIP7’) still awaiting legal followup  
**ON Hold** [“Extended Metadata”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) (potential ‘CIP6’) re: comments and updates  
=> Merge **NOW**: [“Wallet Checksum”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/4) to be merged as ‘Draft’ (‘CIP4’)  
=> Merge **NOW**: [“Message Signing”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/27)to be merged as ‘Draft’ (‘CIP8’)
