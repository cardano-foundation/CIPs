## Summary

Rough writeup of 9/22/20 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.

### Review  


#### Curve Pledge Benefit
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/12) - potential CIP7) 



**Shawn** - (recap) Current pledging incentive mechanism linear setup is less than optimal for <1M ada. The superwhale end of the spectrum provides about 30% benefit for ppl able to pledge their own pool to saturation - By using a curve pledge mechanism instead of a linear one we can incentivise in a better way (for smaller folks/pools).
(see graphs in the PR)  
**Duncan** - Not as simple, incentive folks are exploring all scenarios  
**Collin** - We don’t want for the high end to be the clear winner.I like the form of the solution - almost a smile shape. Not aligned with all but a solid proposal as-is.  
**Duncan** - This has been raised internally with IOHK researchers already - they weren’t so positive about it, but have been looking at it.  
**Colin** - They are in the long term equilibrium - but right now the linear isn’t working.  
**Duncan** - It was mentioned it should probably be skewed in the opposite direction..  
**Colin** - if you can get the delegation bonus as a big holder, you’re much better off splitting into tiny pools right now  
**Duncan** - Researchers are aware of that -  which direction it goes non-linear might cause issues.  
At no point should it be non-rewarding to add more stake to your pool.  
**Markus** - What about a ‘S’ curve mentioned by Charles?  
**Colin** - (Showing example graph) = M * (1/p)  + N * p  
**Markus** - There are some good points or reasons that this can help  
What are the drawbacks or downsides based on a linear and non-linear approach?  
**Frederic** - The conversation about the solution can take place once the CIP has been setup as Draft, suggest we move to merge the PR and let conversation take place beyond.  
***[Move to MERGE as CIP7]*** (all agree)



#### Extended Metadata
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) - potential CIP6)


**Markus** - Recap on the conversation since last meeting: 
Last week Shawn gave some good proposals about a more standardized and well-thought structure for extended metadata.Need a response from ADA Pools as they implemented something without following the Script process.  
**Duncan** - Is there the right balance of features to include? You can try to get consensus amongst operators. Mechanism is important to consider, the other attributes can be decided at a later state.  
**Markus** - We reconsider the maximum size of the metadata file. All other things which are not very crucial, going out quick and sending messages to SPOs can be done in a different way. A potential Metadata proposal should  involve security risks considerations, not just adding  fields.  
**Duncan** - Reasonable to say we can add a few extra fields for metadata and limit the total data size to 1,000 bytes... If security is important, we could have a design Field extended with a URL, have a verification key (public key) which is signed for extended metadata. This means you don’t have to use the same key as your pool code key...  
**Markus** - Need to speak with more pool operators to see the approaches out there. I Will reach out and follow up.  
**Frederic** - Might be good to have competing views and discuss publicly, Multiple CIPs can propose different implementation proposals.  
**Markus** - Some pools have large teams and need metadata. “Cardano Scan” does a good job but is not known. Yoroi and Daedalus have uses of course too.  
**Duncan**- Frontend Daedalus Devs might be concerned about showing metadata when there is a security concern. RSS feed is a good example of a feature in the extended markdown  
**Sebastien** - The pool selection UI is outsourced for Yoroi. One feature we do care about is RSS feed, we would embed this into the UI. The existing proposal doesn't really talk about RSS feed into extended metadata.  
**Matthias** - Re: Daedalus frontend considerations - hard to say, there is a need for the data. Onchain there is not a limit of data. It's enforced by the software (SMASH). we can increase this.  
Can show the hash is on chain, there is a security risk and no way to verify you are looking at the right data. Having a key and hashing that the data is accurate is a good way.  
**Duncan** - If there is a key in the first MD level to sign the second MD level, this is a good mechanism. You could use HTTPS, could have a fingerprint of the hashed certificate, cant be replaced by any other certificates.  
**Markus** - Will look at rewriting the existing PR with assistance of ADApools and reframe/rework proposal next.  
**Frederic** - Can be discussed in comments of the CIP as draft maybe? (would like to bring it in)  
**Duncan** - People should discuss with others in the community (or IOHK).To Markus' rework: focus on security for feedback on Metadata standardization in the first version. Once there is a mechanism and two categories (Convenient and UnConvenient).  
Focus on mechanism, security towards minimum amount of metadata to prevent issues.  
Follow the JSON schema and explanation of each field. BIP44 or BIP32 has a template for similar extensions.  
Future CIPs might want to add additional Metadata fields and should be structured in this way… it’ll provide a template for future discussions.  
**Frederic** - Wrapping up on the meeting: Review ‘CIP6’ in 2 weeks.  
‘Merge of CIP7’ once Legal ok.  
Markus to talk to the community about security and minimal metadata...  
**Sebastien** - CIP4 PR can likely be merged in/ a draft, should it merged? We brought it up in the past + it has been implemented in Yoroi already..  

### Discussions 
N/A - not enough time due to extended reviews.  
CIP4 to be looked at in async channels and moved to next meeting.


### Close

**On Hold** Change Format of CIPs (in CIP1) (instead CIPx.md) - awaiting Frontend fix to auto-gen site  
**TODO**  Merge Curve proposal / ‘CIP7’ once legal oks.
