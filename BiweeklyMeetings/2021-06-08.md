## Summary

Rough writeup of 6/8/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.  

## June 8 2021 notes 

**Attending Editors**: ~Matthias~, Sebastien, Duncan, Frederic. Editorial Guest: Robert Phair. Kevin Hammon (IO Research).  


### Triage  

#### Followups
([PR66](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/66) - "Fair Min Fees")  
([PR21](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/21) - "Non-Centralizing Rankings")  
**Frederic** - Both of those are effectively tabled until we hear back from CSO Aggelos or if the author is fine with moving forward we can merge appropriately.  
**Kevin** - Re: PR66 / "Fair Min Fees" - IOG is considering this and there is a blog post Aggelos has put together relating to the fee structure that should be pushed around now.  
**K** - All fee-related parameters, how they work, are set and the levels. Also min/max settings. Expect an encompassing blog post.   
**D** - So it may or may not address this ([PR66](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/66))...   
**F** - Any update on [PR21](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/21)?   
**D** - I think the same point applies, which is that the researcher have just about completed and are about to provide internal feedback on the pledge benefit curve ([CIP-0007](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0007/README.md)) proposal. It doesn't directly address this PR but it addresses in some sense what comes before that: incentives leading to ranking. So one might want to rethink/adjust "ranking" post incentive tweaking.... I think the situation is basically as it was before and Shawn should be in his right to push for the publishing of these proposals: The researchers at IOHK will get to those proposals in time. Not everything has to be what everyone agrees with and what gets implemented might be a gradient of those.  
**K** - Expecting good news on that is the near future..   
**D** - Shawn might want to revisit the proposal pending changes.  
**K** - The blog is in the final stages, might be out already.   
**F** - Any other update from IO Research?  
**D** - The big one is the one just mentionned, the pledge curve, touching to A0.  
**K** - What we are expecting to see there is a revised pledge-related reward formula: The researchers have been measuring the effects under Myopic and non-Myopic situations. The model proposed by Shawn in his CIP unfortunately had some issues: it works under some situation but not under ALL situations that we would like. The change rationale/rework will likely have the effects Shawn was intending but would not be the same exact same formula.   
**D** - Yes. It does have implications on rankings, as part of looking at the pledge curve they also looked at wether it's okay to look at Myopic vs non-myopic views adn part ofthe question was wether it's more interesting to look at the long term vs. short term. Again, it's very clear that he has a reasonable proposal and it would be fine to publish as is.  
=> Moved to (Last Check) post-email follow-up  

#### Delegation
([PR82](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/82) - potential CIP-0017: "Cardano Delegation Portfolio")  
([PR86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86) / Update to CIP-0013: "Cardano URI Scheme")   
**F** - Any update on the current outreach to the community?  
**Robert** - I have been in touch with (IOHK) Lenna Onto regarding joining the upcoming "SPO community call" this Thursday (June 10th) where I will introduce the stakepool links and confirmed there would be a more general CIP/SPO meeting in two weeks (June 24th). We only have space to introduce the PRs, some links to the discussions and talk about what is coming up in the future + how that would enable the delegation options (json, ++ ). The point of this intro is to start getting feedback from SPOs, maybe get some timeline, expectations of precision and what else might have come out and/or suggestions, pushing users towards posting in the forum or github threads, and remind that the merging/inclusion in the CIP repo does not imply implementation (Governance process being separate and also needing their voice). Trying to get that in 5 minutes and opening up to a question is the aim for that meeting, with the follow-on meeting as a way to onboard SPOs further in the CIP conversation.  
**F** - So the follow-on SPO community meeting on the 24th is specifically the "delegation" meeting? Or should it be a more broader look at the CIP framework?  
**R** - Up to Ben's team. I've made myself available to jump in to educate as much as feasible. I think the focus is going to be JUST about CIPs.  

#### NFT
([PR85](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/85) - potential CIP: "NFT Metadata Standard")  
**F** - [PR85](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/85) (NFT metadata standard) was discussed at the last meeting - there was a new comment in there from Matthias...   
**Sebastien** - I read through last comments and I think it makes sense, but the conversation seem to have died afterwards. We have to figure out how we define when the PR/CIP is good enough to be merged.  
**F** - The past back-and-forth here (on this PR) appeared to be consolidating towards a Schema.org-style of disintermediating, using some kind of subspace of ... NFT space thing?   
**S** - Alessandro (PR author) has the last comment rather open - as Editors we might have to step in to figure out the path to proceed - ex: there is no discussion, do we close, merge, etc... we should do something.  
**F** - Without Matthias present (as the closest to this PR) we are lacking maybe closer educated opinion.  
**D** - Clearly a topic with a lot of interest and we should probably be guided by "has the state of discussion died down enough to.."  
**S** - Alessandro not providing clear steps, folks already having implemented this standard, Alessandro currently working on building his own wallet: there seem to be grounds for merging - some standard is emerging.  
**D** - "Existing Implementation" is a good step toward considering something as becoming standard: competing standards are perfectly OK.  
**S** - IOHK has a wallet, Emurgo has a wallet and everybody who has a wallet is interested in joint NFTs in some way shape or form: it would be nice if we could coordinate and wrap this up so it doesn't cause issues later.  
**D** - Have you checked if this is "more" about images? (or if it should be exclusive to images or other..)  
**S** - That is what Matthias' last comment is about (trying to use a schema) but there's no clear path forward after this. At this point up in the air, previous discussions were about spliting it up (i.e. for Images and other kinds) but I don't know of anyone who actually put in the work for doing that.  
**F** - We are at a standstill - I propose we move this for Review for next meeting and invite Alessandro to the follow on meeting. (**S** - He's very active on social, let's reach out).  
=> [PR85](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/85) - "NFT Metadata Standard" moved to next meeting's Review + Author (Alessandro) invited to next meeting  

#### CIP0015
**S** - [PR89](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/89)/Update to CIP-0015, should be good to merge NOW, it's just updating the test vectors (matching what has already been implemented): For Round4 (Catalyst Fund4) they decided that the address specified in the metadata would not be the receiving address for rewards and rather the rewards would be handed out via mirror certificate again.  
**F** - Do we need Matthias to review?   
**D** - Happy to merge this one as-is.  
=> Merge NOW   

#### Update Scripts
**S** - [PR97](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/97) "Script to update ..." is not something that should be processed through the actual editorial grooup, not a CIP itself  
**F** - I'm assuming it is touching to the auto-generated site located at [cips.cardano.org](https://cips.cardano.org/) helps people browse CIPs themselves.  
 => Move to merge as soon as we have CF FrontEnd review.   

#### dApp connector
**F** - the next one is [PR88](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/88) - "Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge". Did you get to look at it?  
**S** - Not worth talking about today: they are still tweaking a lot of things in there.  
**K** - Work on the dApp connector is being done within IOG...  
**S** - They (IOG) are welcome to add comments in this PR then: Yoroi ppl are implementing it now, and others in the community are also implementing this as-is. So there is a more involved conversation happening as usecases are still emerging. This will change over time and that's why I feel it's not worth digging into it, folks are adding comments in the threads.  
=> Tabling PR88 for FUTURE meeting conversation   


#### Other
**F** - [PR80](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/80) seem ready to merge. It adds to CIP-0010 (registry namespacing)  
**S** - Is this related to SPOCRA? It's been some time and things are a bit stale: If they are actually using this and there are transactions on chain that use it, I don't mind merging it. (I don't know if they ever did anything with it as there are no comments)
=> add to the thread and ask for example of use  
**F** - [PR83](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/83) - any reason why this is on hold. (**S** - No comments in there so on hold)  
=> do nothing.   



### Last Check   


### Review  


#### Forging keys
**F** - [PR96](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/96) (potential CIP-1855: "Forging policy keys for HD Wallets") - that's Derivation path for forging Tokens.  
**S** - No rush to do anything, PR is kindal stalled. Not much to go over. I think it's fine as-is and wouldn't mind merging it. It isn't anything too significant, just that we need a set of keys for forging tokens, unrelated to the wallet itself (not like you're forging from your wallet). They needed some key to forge, this is the same thing they did for Catalyst registration - and so created a derivation path for it. Same template, just change the path.  
=> move to Last Check for next meeting + add Matthias for review.   


### Discussions  

**F** - (thoughts about proactively trying to advance the CIP statuses as most remain as "Draft") + (Discussion)  
**R** - There's been only a couple of ppl interested in pursuing the SPO links (publicized in the forums late september and a few other places) - see links. Because of the way things delvelopped, nobody know about it and we will have to wait until thursday to get some feedback. This information about the potential of SP links, we tried to get it in the forefront about 8 months ago before folks here pushed to discuss.  
**K** these are the links to known stakepools right? (**R** - yes). I've seen SPO discuss this on TG and they weren't aware of this somehow pulled. The SPO that we pulled were picked rather than nominated.  
**R** - Glad that we're getting it out in the open  
**K** - This is on a private TG channel. If you want to get something in front of the SPO community then Ben is the right guy to contact for that. We have channels we use to inform SPOs..  
**R** - I subscribed to that list yet I thought it was already made clear (that the CIP was there and what it would do, including marketing potential for SPOs) a few months ago. I thought that that meant that the issue wouldn't be covered in his channel. People were talking about publishing videos and other.  And so many people might be linking to their stakepool...   
**K** - you need to ask Ben there.
