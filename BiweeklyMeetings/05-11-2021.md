## Summary

Rough writeup of 5/11/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.  

## May 11 2021 notes 

**Attending Editors**: Matthias, Sebastien, ~Duncan~, Frederic. Research Guest: Roman Oliynykov (IOHK).  


### Triage  

#### Followups
([PR66](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/66) - "Fair Min Fees")  
([PR21](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/21) - "Non-Centralizing Rankings")  
**Frederic** - Roman (from IOHK Research) was looking at these as well as Colin - however the timezone might be an issue to get updates. There were inquiries from the community to see if we could get a better insight from IO research, do we have any updates regarding either of those.  
**Roman** - It's a side of my research right now and being brought up to the next Chief Scientist meeting next wednesday. There is deep theoretical research on game theory and equilibrium towards a given number of stakepools - I also agree with this approach. I also agree that tasks raised in these CIPs are essential and need to be researched more. It's a side of my research and will be discussed more with (IOHK Chief Scientist) Aggelos. I looked at both of those and will provide details regarding those to him for discussion.  

#### Minor PRs
**Matthias** - Three major PRs are currently ready to be merged and we can push those through quickly:  
1 - A bot dependancy fix. nothing to see, let's merge unless someone is against it.  
2 - A Minor one about some linkfixes.  
3 - A PR from Mikhail to separate data into its own file so it can be parsed seaprately and whatnot. I think this is something we could encourage when writing CIPs, When people have separate files, they should try to aim to put them outside of the CIP itself and keep the CIP itself in prose while the data can be as its own file.  
**Sebastien** - I approved all those.  
=> merge NOW.  

### Last Check   

### Review  

#### NFT  
([PR85](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/85) - potential CIP: "NFT Metadata Standard")  
**F** - It felt we had a good overview the prior meeting, but we might do a recap for recording viewers or such...  
**S** - I've read through this PR. I think there's been a lot of good points (that I agree with) but it looks like some of those conversations are still ongoing.  
**M** - Apotential thing we should be careful with, is using the blockchain as a datastore. For instance, this here is suggesting we put the entire metadata on the blockchain itself, then for each token there's a set of fields / metadata which needs to be encoded and use space: it (the blockchain) is not an ideal tool for that. The blockchain is good to ensure that content has not been tampered with... it's a Ledger, not a Database. Rather we should probably encourage a hash (of the metadata) onchain with a URL pointing to the (hosted) metadata offchain in a separate server. Like we did for stakepools and various other things. Not completely settled on having everything in there, even though it would be conveniently small and accessible (onchain), without needing a server to host the whole things. Plus it has also already been done a few times. I'm not sure how we can prevent people from doing it directly still.  
**S** - I have to agree. The problem I have with this standard is in this standard, we have a name, a description, but I can imagine multiple standards that (also) have multiple names and descriptions conflicting (for example if a token is trying to follow multiple standards)  
**M** - And it is also more readily expandable in a way   
**S** - I feel requiring people to put an IPFS link and a hash would not be a big issue as users are already uploading images and linking them through IPFS (so this would be something they would be familiar with)  
**M** - It seems they have considered the offchain approach in the [forum post](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-nft-metadata-standard/45687) but not in this CIP(PR) itself. The offchain approach would still miss a hash because you wouldn't be able to trust any content you get...  
**F** - Isn't IPFS linked to Ethereum?  
**S** - No. It's 'used' by Ethereum but not linked in any way. It is somewhat linked to a project called filecoin (a blockchain) the group behind IPFS. Consensys does work with Filecoin on some projects and so they have some unoficial partnerships and things like that.  
**M** - I think we can suggest what we said last time still. This CIP seem to be more clearly focused on images and so while most NFTs seem to be images at the moment, this CIP is accordingly skewed towards images right now. It could be that this '721' label is reserved for image NFTs and so putting a link to an image on the IPFS network could be sufficient (provided there is a hash). Different story if it's a IPFS client ID or similar. I don't think we need any of the outside fields... Which actually posits multiple issues because it's not only about the image: they also want to have a name and other fields, which means the IPFS links should probably NOT be an image but the actual metadata. Hm.  
**S** - That's what we want: We want the description to also be offchain, they could be pretty long for some.  
**M** - For me that's why we'd probably want these files (fields) removed from this PR here and limit ourselves to images only. We don't need files or mime type, you can simply assume an image enforces png for example as format..  
**S** - I think this is still open for discussion so far. People have not been convinced either way.    
**M** - Which leaves the name and description.  
**S** - I feel this (name and description) is something we should have had from the start when we launched multiassets.  
**M** - You mean upon minting Tokens?  
**S** - Yes, it would not have been perfect, but having this as separate field would have made it easier for adding support in wallet or expanding. And standards such as 721 would not have to fight or multiply-define "name" or "description" multiple times. If we want to double down on the Token registry to act as the place for names and descriptions (rather than have it onchain) then we should remove these from 721. Else if we want to have metadata onchain then we should extract it from here (721) and put it in a separate namespace so it can be used by other standards as well. So I feel we have to pick one or the other.  
**M** - You're right, but I am still not convinced by the onchain approach on that, especially with all the NFTs that are being minted everyday nowadays. The Blockchain is currently 8GB for Cardano, 5 of which were just generated since the Allegra era, so yea, the transactional volume has increased but also the size of the transactions that were submitted. We could probably measure the impact of all the metadata being submitted onchain at the moment and I also agree that we already have an offchain solution for that: we should probably push that a bit more. The name and description are already covered by the Cardano Registry. Adding a new wellknown property as an img that is a link to an IPFS link should be trivial...  
**F** - Any way to multipurpose the Logo field for that?  
**M** - I would still keep them separated. The Logo was intended for actual currencies, having a different field might make more sense.  
**F** - Regarding the Cardano Token Registry (an instance of a Metadata Registry) from the Foundation side that was intently meant to handle coin-like token - I think the more functionalities get grafted on it the more you will see some pushback on the new functionalities beign added. Unless if you're talking about the more general server code that IO is making available.  
**M** - The server in itself is a centralized solution, but the metadata format itself is not, and so it can be transported to a different server if desired. There is nothing the server provide that cannot be transfered to another instance. There is only one hosted by the CF right now, but in that sense it's only semi-centralized: You don't really have to trust the server itself as the data itself is authenticated and self-contained. Having said that, it's true that the format is very much tailored towards 'currencies'. If you were to do that for 100 NFTs you'd need 100 different files, all with different subjects, which is not practical.  
**F** - The CF registry as a solution might not be ready for that kind of setup..  
**M** - Having things in one single file would not really change much - you wouldn't have to repeat some of the field but you'd still need all the other ones. And still minting 10K entities might be a bit too much but also a reason to not put that onchain (which would be large for no reason).  
**F** - Maybe the NFT conversation regarding images might be more focused on the format: something we could either add onchain or offchain on a registry. I'm hearing your point as the offchain solution being really 'semi-centralized', the same way as the CIP platform more or less.  
**M** - My recommendation here is: "Have the lightweight metadata onchain if indeed it is limited to a name and a description. For any more elaborate metadata, we need an offchain solution." But that is still not satisfactory I think..  
**F** - For this PR - let's add a comment in the PR with the caveat that this is a 'recommendation' - also noting that this PR is still going to be reviewed again next meeting, with the understand that we aren't trying to find a perfect solution - it sounds as the lead recomendation has been to refocus on image NFT for this PR leaving the greater NFT conversations out for continued discussions.  
**M** - Definately one of the points we want to communicate - also really want to emphasize the Blockchain is not meant as a database - and should not be used to store content, which should probably favorize offchain solutions. This is a good conversation to extend with the Author of course. I don't think there is a clear case for the storing of items on the chain, besides the readily availability of metadata as you synchronize the blockchains, and you wouldn't have to fetch that from a different ressource or server - but you already have to fetch the image from a different server, and since that cost is there, then we might as well build on such kind of solution. I can understand that the current Cardano Token Registry (an instance of a Metadata server) is maybe too centralized for that, but then we need a better (more decentralized) solution that doesn't require storing things on chain.  
=> Adding a note in the PR + leaving in Review for next meeting.  



#### Cardano Delegation Portfolio  
([PR82](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/82) - potential CIP-0017: "Cardano Delegation Portfolio")  
**M** - There was a last remark from Robert as we were discussing the 'Decimals' on other proposals - which is sortof related - to extend the URI scheme for delegation portfolio as well. I added a response here in the PR (which was also discussed in our last meeting), saying that we want to avoid using floating arithmatic as much as possible and that's why we use plain integers as weights and ratios, so they can be represented as fractions and more importantly those ratios do not need to be precise because there is no way in the end to achieve that precision in the end for the wallets (it will always be an approximation), and so they are rather a "direction" for the wallet to know how to balance its utxo accross pools rather than a perfect target. (going over the PR comments)  
**M** - Several points in the latest comments - the first one is about the protocol change for having multi stakepools and ratios between stakepool delegations as it was done basically for jormungandr at the time (for the ITN). This is a completely different topic and I don't see this happening any time soon in the actual Haskell implementation (for various reasons). I agree with Robert and Sebastien here that it would be cleaner and a lot easier for many of the consumers downstream but it isn't really doable at this stage from the latest feedback we got from the core team: that's why we went for a pure wallet solution regarding the multidelegation. That also doesn't prevent us from deprecating a CIP later on if this gets implemented. In the eventuality where it will be implemented we might already want to have a CIP that is compatible with that (although we have no idea if the core team would use pure floating points or use ratio like the Jormungandr team did at the time)...  
**M** - The second point is that we cannot say that we want to use Integers (and not decimals) because we don't need the precision brought by the decimals. One might want to actually have a very precise representation of your portfolio despite the wallet not being able to enforce it, because there might be other consumers of that representation (third-party services). Taking the point of view of the wallet is a bit bias.  
**M** - The final argument states that it would be easier to use decimals in here here because the interface will most likely display decimals to users - and most users prefer to deal with percentage or things like that rather than plainweights - Still, should the UX also impact the underlying format we want to enforce? I don't see a strong justification for one or the other in the end, it seems more like a preference matter. I'd argue for integers but I can also understand Robert's arguments. These are different approaches. I would prefer to have consistence betweek the Link approach and the JSON approach. But I don't see any strong arguments for the Decimals or the Integers really. I might be bias coming from a wallet perspective - there having integers (as plain weights) would be easier to manipulate rather than with decimals. And since it's not going to be a precise measure anyways, we don't care for floating arithmetic precision in here: it will never be exactly matching the portfolio weights anyway so being off by a few decimals doesn't really change anything to your wallet distribution. Plain decimals might be more transparent for people, especially if we require decimals to have a fixed number of places, and the scope may be between 'this' and 'this', to represent actual precentage. The annoying thing (with decimals) is that we likely want them to sum up to 1. It would make no sense to have a portfolio delegating '150%'. Integers as weights would solve this from context.   
**S** - I still need to reflect on the comments, but have commented loosely a few times. I will get back to this.  
=> leaving in review for next meeting + Flag to Robert.  


#### Cardano URI Scheme  
([PR86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86) / Update to CIP-0013: "Cardano URI Scheme")  
**M** - A similar conversation, this time from the Link perspective - the idea here is to define the portfolios as a set of stakepools but also with proportions (the equivalent of the weights in the earlier proposal). With the proportion as a decimal number, any number of digits and any number of decimals as well. Not sure how much more can be said beyond what was earlier discussed for [PR82](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/82).. (reading in the PR) This is the same meaning as the integer weights, it simply defines fractions of decimals, the proportion itself is still to be interpreted in the context as integer proportion - what I said previously (about having to sum up to 1) doesn't really apply here. Putting aside the integer/decimal question, there should be ONLY ONE WAY to specify proportions. Here it suggests a lot of different default cases ("if there is no proportion", "if there is only one"...) If no proportion is given, it should be an invalid proposal IMO (in the same way that weights should always be required in the other proposal). If a stakepool is mentionned multiple time it should also be invalid. (adding a commment in the PR)
