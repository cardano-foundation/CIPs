## Summary

Rough writeup of 4/27/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.

### Triage  

 N/A

### Last Check   


#### Update to CIP-0015  
([PR71](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/71) - Update to CIP-0015: "Catalyst Registration Transaction")   
**S** - I had forgotten to update the PR - Will do that right now, but otherwise good to go. (This PR now strictly adds the test vectors and nothing else).  
=> Merge now  

#### Update to CIP-0015-1  
([PR79](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/79) - Update to CIP-0015: "Catalyst Registration Transaction")   
**F** - Prior Editors conversation went over the review from Vaccuum Labs team and suggested that authors change the 'Nonce' field to "slot number" as it functions as a counter...  
**D** - We put a comment to that effect and they came back with this being used elsewhere and generally preferring "Nounce".  
(Conversation around wether the naming should use "slot number" rather than "nonce". As evidenced from other uses and checking definitions, "Nonce" is fine)   
**D** - This is really a naming issue, withdrawing request as they pointed to prior use with naming.   
**M** - OK.   
=> Merge now   

#### Cardano Addresses    
([PR78](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/78) - Potential CIP-0019: "Cardano Addresses")    
**M** - The past conversation was that this was good to go - there is some conflict in the readme likely from a separate merge. Resolving.  
=> Merge now   

#### Multi-signatures HD Wallets  
([PR69](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/69) - potential CIP-1854: "Multi-signatures HD Wallets")  
**F** - This is the one we had a lengthy conversation last time (1854).    
**M** - The changes from last time were to change the purpose instead of adding a new role - we will use a new purpose (1854) to distinguish multisg wallet from standard wallets and will keep the same coin type.  And we will keep a structure similar to the structure defined in 1852 and as a summary I recapped all that in a small table, but leaving the 'role=1' out, which is reserved for the internal adddresses in the standard wallets but will remain unused in the multisignature wallets so we will only use '0' for the payment keys and '2' for the stake keys after that the structure is the same. One account which is hardened and an index not hardened. This prevent mixing up a standard wallet and a shared wallet and also makes it possible to share the cosigners the account key without exposing your other normal payment keys to your cosigners - and makes it easier to extend both proposals, such as adding new roles for 1852 and piggyback on the same structure for 1854. For example the voting key could be added as a new role here (ex role=3) that could be added. Re: user-facing encoding we have defined new prefixes for the bech32 encoding so there isn't a shared prefix for all the keys coming from this particular proposal. I made the update to [CIP-0005](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0005/README.md) directly, and it setups parallel for every key - [CIP-1852](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1852/README.md) and [CIP-1854](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-1854/README.md) have their own formats. I added a bit to CIP-1852 to explain the rationale - if intent simply to extend the existing roles with a completely different semantic then it's fine to add a new role. The part about discovering the template does not change.   
**D** - Nice. I think that's good.   
**S** - LGTM too - I approved it.   
=> Merge now   


### Review  

#### NFT  
([PR85](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/85) - potential CIP: "NFT Metadata Standard")  
**D** - A lot of conversation about the NFT CIP PR...  
**M** - This is one of those for which I wanted to do a summary - there has been a lof of conversation on that and people also seem to disagree on the goal of that CIP...  
**F** - Oftentimes people seem to not grasp "NFT"  
**D** - Why does one need a standard here? you can already create them. What's the standard for?  
**M** - This standard is mostly about associating metadata (or more exactly content) with the token encountered onchain (NFT) - this proposal is mostly about linking the association of data with the minting. But this proposal is mostly about "images". So there is some will to also associate NFTs with anything you can link (video / anything that has URL/MIME type) - but here some seem to be arguing as this being solely about images rather than a wide-reaching NFT standard. I think it makes sense overall but we would need to include content hashing - but they should also rename the proposal accordingly to not have some overly generic format.  
**D** - That makes sense - So really it's "metadata to be associated with an NFT" to say what it is, rather.  
**F** - This goes back to NFTs "as experienced" on Ethereum, such as smart-contracts complying with a standard (ERC721). We don't have those standards yeton Cardano, this might be a first step for images here. We have one registry run by the CF, but not pushed as a standard - which has a set of metadata attributes that it can associate. I feel it's rushing a little bit until we have a distributed setup (smart-contracts).  
**M** - I think the rationale was here trying to document how "Spacebudz" as an application setup their NFTs - So they wanted to write down the approach those guys took onchain so other applications can reuse it similarly (for images NFTs). "General" NFT conversation might be better to put somewhere else, such as a future CIP that would be MORE generic..  
**F** - So this sounds like the CIP is perfectly fine, if reframed a bit?  
**M** - Yes - modulo  a few corrections. I wouldn't put anything about the MIME type in there for example. Really should be images only so future CIPs can be more generic for NFTs. This has values in itself, such as "My app supports CIP-122 (madeup) for images" while another conflicting image standard might defines a different approach that some other app took. We don't have to choose which is the better one, just that it makes sense.  
**S** - I think that's a good summary - I haven't had time to go through it, but maybe it's settled down for now?  
**M** - I don't mind making a summary of the conversation so far and opening it for next meeting.  
**F** - Will add to the thread so people are notified.  
**M** - I'll add something at the end of the github conversation, summarizing what I just proposed - add content hashing, and making the focus on image.   
=> Add comment in thread (**M**) + Moved to Review for next meeting.  



#### Cardano Delegation Portfolio  
([PR82](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/82) - potential CIP-0017: "Cardano Delegation Portfolio")  
**M** - [PR86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86) came out as an offshoot of [PR82](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/82) - so they are linked. There was an extensive comment from Robert on 82, suggesting to use URLs to transport the portfolios information rather than using an external json file - more cumbersome to generate and pass along -  while a link is easier to modify as just text... I don't think these two cancel eachothers, but are complementary. It would be good to get someone like that on both URI and JSON schemes.  
**M** - Robert makes a good point on the framing of the CIP, the motivation for it: there is a monetary incentive to split your delegation into multiple stakepool, especially for users that have a lot of money or stake. I do agree with the comment on motivation - As soon as a user reaches a certain ammount of stake (enough to over-saturate a pool) there is a motivation for you to split your ada into multiple pools. Then there is the question of allowing decimals (which I am strongly against in that proposal): This proposal uses plain integers as weights, exactly to cope with problems that come with floating arithmetic especially with json and javascript kindof world where this is often causing issues. The illusion of precision that you get with decimals in the end is unecessary for this particular proposal because there is no way you can achieve that level of precision anyways with a wallet - the "best effort target" for the wallet. That's really what it is. A wallet is defined in several UTXOs and you can only associate A particular UTXO to A particular stakepool which means that in a way you have the granularity that your UTXOs give you. If you have 2 UTXOs in  your wallet there is no way you can delegate to 3 stakepools at the same time (you'd need to break down your utxos and whatnot). Having the illusion of "precision" with decimal numbers doesn't make sense for that because you will not be able to achieve it anyway with a wallet. That's why we went for a "weight", a sort of indicator that your wallet is supposed to "try" to achieve delegation according to the weight, and is fine - maybe it could be called "best effort" or be highlighted more in the description, although I thought I did.  
=> (Tentative) Moved to Review for next meeting.


#### Cardano URI Scheme  
([PR86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86) / Update to CIP-0013: "Cardano URI Scheme")  
**M** - This is using decimals as proportions which we probably do not want as explaind earlier, and I will comment in this PR itself. And it would be good to get alignment between the portfolio as json and the portfolio as URL. With which we would actually redefine this [CIP-0013](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0013/README.md) and provide a more general structure and have something a bit more like what was done for the metadata label registry ([CIP-0010](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0010/README.md)). (For the metadata it was essentially imposed by the blockchain format really) and say this is how it works and this is a registry for the various actions that can be recognized.  
**S** - My main Q for the portfolio stuff is still if we can get it implemented in the actual Cardano nodes themselves: The single stake key, with the multi-pool delegation... We were previously told "possibly in the future"... With the Alonzo integration into the node wrapping up maybe more bandwidth would enable that?   
**M** - The last info I have on that is basically that "no" we aren't going to bring this into the node (at least immediately) because of all the complications it brings. I am not aware of any long range target. It could be that we have this notion of portfolios for now, but it might be deprecated in the future if there is the capability.  
**S** - It feels we're moving the complexity from one place to another. But the PR is fine as is, I have no issue approving it and merging it.  
=> (Tentative) Moved to Review for next meeting.
