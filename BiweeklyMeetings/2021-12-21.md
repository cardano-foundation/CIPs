## Summary

Rough writeup of 12/21/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.  

## December 21 2021 notes 

**Attending Editors**: Matthias Benkort, ~Duncan Coutts~, Sebastien Guillemot, Frederic Johnson, ~Robert Phair~. 


### Triage  

#### Licensing
**Frederic** - This [forum post](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-007-for-intellectual-property-licensing-legal-documents-inside-nft-metadata/86116) was brought up last meeting as a topic surrounding IP licensing and ppossible approaches, such as tweaking CIP 25 (NFT Metadata Standard) or adding fields - There have been other conversations, this is a reminder to engage preferably on the Forum for now (as there are no PR threads yet). I recall some were concerned on possible vulnerabilities.  
**Matthias** - I think the idea makes sense generally. But if we are putting documents (or links towards documents) on-chain, then we should also remind people to add that document's hash on-chain next to it - this wouldn't allow updating the license afterwards (unless we think it through various schemes..) but for the purpose here might be sufficient.  
**F** - Reminder, this is Forum/post level, no PR out yet => weigh-in over there for interest or to support.  

=> no action needed  

#### Alonzo
[PR140 - tentative CIP 28: "Protocol Parameters (Alonzo)"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/140)  
**F** - This is the Alonzo protocol parameters from IOG/Kevin, an upgrade continuing on [CIP 9](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0009) (Shelley Protocol Parameters). Last meeting conversation centered around wether this should be merged or not. The PR has the appropriate number of approvals, but the discussion/holdout was about the parameters themselves having changed since initial Alonzo deploy (ex: increase in BlockSize). Question was should it be merge as-is or changed? My understanding is that this CIP is intent as the "initial" snapshot, and that updates should be pushed as separate CIPs/PRs..  
**M** - A few things here, notably echo'd by Mark in the PR, asking if that CIP should be a Standard instead of Informational. The thing is this CIP is currently Informational in the sense that it gives a description of what was chosen for the genesis of Alonzo. If it had come ahead of Alonzo and been discussed, then it should probably have been a Standards track. And this goes with how we want to move the process for parameters, which effectively means defining how things go from discussion to implementation. Which is started with the new Plutus Core changes. For this one, as it is just describing the upgradeable parameters in the Genesis, I don't think we should actually mention the Block parameter update/change. If we do, it could be at a later stage, with maybe a section of all the updates, noting what/when.  
**F** - It describes "changes that have occured since CIP 9 (Shelley)" but remains vague  
**M** - Similarly, we updated the parameters for Shelley 'post CIP-0009 publication' and I don't believe we updated that one either. Perhaps we could clarify the message in both CIPs to make it clear values provided might not necessarily reflect the values for the protocol (for both CIPs) i.e. not sure we want to keep track of all the updates in the CIPs themselves - it would be cumbersome to manage over time, rather we have ways to query the parameters and that should be sufficient I imagine. To me the added value of these two CIPs are about providing descriptions and semantics for the parameters themselves: the values (from the CIPs) might be interesting (to get a general idea of magnitude) but should anyway not be used directly in any application. If you write an APP relying on protocol parameters you should properly query them directly from the network, so the CIP here is really 'Informational' in that sense.  
**Sebastien** - It's not like we should change anything now - it's really the order we pick things for now, so we migth as well stay with informational and maybe in the future switch the order up to properly reflect network params.  
**F** - This has been a 'Last Check' for 3 or 4 meetings, are we fine merging as-is?  
**S** - Fine with it.   
**M** - Same, we can always setup a PR after that to adjust the wording a bit.  

=> Merging NOW [PR140](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/140) as CIP-0028  

### Last Check   

N/A

### Review  

#### CIP30
[PR148 - Update to CIP 30 (signData API)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/148)   
**F** - The PR is a continuation of the conversation regarding adding the signData API to [CIP-0030](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0030). There were some conversations ongoing in this specific PR  
**S** - The conversation is still active  
**M** - I think the discussion is mainly regarding the format we want to use for the interface: the approach + the functions everyone is mostly ok with such as the intent, using COSE as a signing envelope. The question so far were more along the line of "what sort of format do we take for address, payload, response?"  
**F** - Can you expand on what COSE is?  
**M** - There are two distinct things in CIP-0030 really. For signing you have one thing, which is what wallets do. It was specified in the past and is clear. This PR is more about signing arbitrary payload (not necessarily a TX) it could be about proving your identity with your wallet: some server or app might send you a challenge and if you can prove that you own the private key by signing the challenge in a way that doesn't expose your keys or make your app vulnerable. For example you wouldn't want to accept any random string so you don't accidentally sign an adversarial Tx. So we need a protocol to define how it should be modeled and so we can have a result that is portable, and contains all the information that is needed for the application to verify how it was done, with what key etc.. This PR here is just about the signData endpoint which was left as a Work in Progress when we merged the [CIP-0030]((https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0030)) before.   
**S** - (looking at the PR comments) I think this discussion is still too early to talk about merging here, a lot still in the air.  
  
=> On Hold / Tabled (depends on activity, check-in next meeting) [PR148](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/148)   



#### 159
[PR159 / potential CIP 31: "Reference Inputs"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/159)   
**S** - For reference inputs, one of the problems we have is that it's really open how far we want to go on this, and we need inputs from companies and people that might want to actually use this, to get their feedback on how far we should go (re: inputs). There are a huge spectrum in this CIP here and scope for inputs. So I am not sure how far that is coming along. On my side I still need to spend more time thinking about different usecases we might want to make sure we consider, what level of functionality. We should get this out in front of people as quickly as possible so they can push out their opinions in the public space/PR.   
**F** - Conversation is ongoing and still seems to be going on from where it was two weeks ago. MPJ was with us last Editors meeting ([35](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/BiweeklyMeetings/2021-12-07.md)) and we touched to it then. This is another one that will likely get carried into the following meeting with the accompanying (potential CIPs) [PR160](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/160) & [PR161](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/161).  
**M** - I haven't followed the conversation close enough here - I am familiar with the ideas but not the conversations. Let's move it further out.  

=> On Hold / Tabled (depends on activity, check-in next meeting)  

#### 160
[PR160 / potential CIP 32: "Inline Datums"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/160)  
**M** - (Knowing that this CIP really only make sense on top of the previous one) it is "a" way to embed some actual information in the UTXO. At the moment one can't really encode into the hash, because the hash, requires some data that will reduce to that hash. With the idea of reference inputs, you can now think of those Datums as  way to embed some level of information. Specially, the datums that you would want to put in that place are much smaller than an actual hash, and so more practical. An example usecase would be oracles: publishing some data onchain, so that it can be refered to by other scripts to leverage the oracle (whatever it might provide, such as price conversion, source of randomness... etc)   
**F** - Wondering, why aren't those "bundled" CIPs not one major CIP?  
**M** - That's something that was discussed with MPJ when they first wrote all those CIPs, but since they were quite isolated pieces of change in the end, we thought it made more sense to divide them into 3 different CIPs. The first two are definately related, and 32 requires 31. But CIP 33 is a a CIP on its own: it could exist without the other two, but it's part of the same batch because they are all related, the approaches are similar for 33 and 31 for example.   

=> On Hold / Tabled (depends on activity, check-in next meeting)  

#### 161
[PR 161 / potential CIP 33: "Reference scripts"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/161)  
**M** - This PR as (potential) CIP 33 is really to have a way to "import" some code, other validators in your validator: it's a way to reference existing scripts off the blockchain within your script, and that allows you to reduce drastically the size of a transaction because you no longer need to repeat a script every time you want to use it (currently done by embedding it in all TXs it is used). With this proposal, you would put in a reference to a script, so instead of having the full code, you'd have the hash plus some identifier (ex: TxID or other): A pointer to a script basically. This would be one of the most important addition to Plutus and the greater framework for Cardano in my opinion and would be something to pursue.   
**F** - The direct reference to CIP 31 and 32 is the relying on the reference inputs and the datum for script reference?  
**M** - No, it's rather a construct on top of that: it's sort of the opposite way of going about it. Similar but opposed to CIP 31 approach: CIP 31 gives you a way to reference inputs, this one here gives you a way to reference outputs (similar train of thoughts)  
**F** - Still ongoing conversation, please refer to the PR threads to participate. As it kinda functions as a bundle with 31 & 32, will roll this into the following meetings.   

=> On Hold / Tabled (depends on activity, check-in next meeting)  

### Discussions  

#### Network Registry
**S** - [PR158 - tentative CIP 34: "Network Registry"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/158) has been open for a month or so and nobody had any objections to the format as it stands it seems. This here describes a standardized way of representing a network in Cardano, such as when saying "My product supports the testnet" => Which testnet? There are multiple.. Currently people refer to them by name or some ad-hoc way of representing it, such as chainID, networkID or a human-readable format, and what we really need is some format that simplifies/lists all the network in Cardano and how specific networks might align with this format. Something that lets you understand the format. Other chains have that kind of registry for their testnets and such, Cardano hadn't needed it due to mostly using only two networks, but over time we are expecting different kinds of networks evolving, so we want to establish some standardized way of referring to Network. Here one of them is a longform json, which includes information, and the other one is kind of a key, so you can use it as a lookup in a registry. This CIP here defines both of those standards, which makes it come with a registry.json, to store future information, and the different networks of Cardano (right now with the two main ones). It also defines a standard for shortform notation, which is CIP34:networkID-networkmagic and this format follows the chain-agnostic improvement proposal that other chains are also following (everyone has essentially aligned to that format).  
**M** - Makes sense.  
**S** - There was one alternative where we could have used bech32, but it wouldn't make it readable: no real benefit to it, so I just kept things simple. I also created a json implementation of this CIP as well (that you can find in the CIP itself in the reference implementation section). If no particular objections, I would like to move this to 'Last Check'.  
**F** - Fine here: a reserve I have is the over-reliance on the CIP repo with all the varied registries being setup.  
**S** - We probably shouldn't have these registries in the CIP repo, but the other options were awkward (ex: dcSpark maintaining a registry..) This is an endless problem really: nobody wants to be legally responsible for registries (due to exposure and risks)  

=> Moving [PR158](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/158) to 'Last Check' for next meeting  


#### Statuses
**F** - Last discussed was [CIP-0012](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0012), as 'Draft'. Reminder: it is up to the implementer to champion the drive to advance a CIP status.  
**F** - [CIP-0013: "Cardano URI Scheme"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0013) is currently as 'Draft' -> should it be advanced?   
**M** - This has been fairly used in a few applications online and if I recall correctly even Yoroi supports it.  
**S** - Yes.  
**F** - Sebastien (as co-author for this one) are you fine moving this to 'Active'?  
**S** - The reason we are waiting on this is that the Daedalus team was about to make changes, and it hasn't happened yet.  
**M** - It's incoming - but I have no idea when.. There is an internal document, I don't know when the team is planning on making it public but it doesn't really change the core of the CIP, more like adding new constructors for covering DApp-related ULR sharing... A way to leverage the PAB as a URL, or as a partial transaction as URL so that it can be signed in an arbitrary wallet. You could also imagine using that in all the other wallets - for interacting with the PAB. But the other wallets have to be integrated with [CIP-0030](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0030) .. but that's irrelevant - I might ping Nicolas again.  
**F** - Fine to leave as 'Draft' for now  


### Close    

=> **Merged** as CIP-0028 (Draft) - [PR140 - CIP 28: "Protocol Parameters (Alonzo)"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0028)  
=> Hold on [PR148 - Update to CIP 30 (signData API)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/148) as still active conversation  
=> Continuing discussions for [PR159](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/159), [PR160](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/160) and [PR161](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/161) ("Reference Inputs", "Inline Datums" and "Reference Scripts")   
=> Moving [PR158 / tentative CIP 34: "Network Registry"](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/158) to 'Last Check'
