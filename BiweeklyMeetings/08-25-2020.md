## Summary

Rough writeup of 8/25/20 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.



## August 25 2020 notes


**Attending**: (Duncan, Frederic, Matthias, ~~Sebastien~~) + Ben (CF)



### Triage
N/A

### Last Check
Merging in meeting notes to publicize the process itself

### Review  
#### CIP2
> **Matthias** - This is a lengthy CIP and will benefit from a more thorough review. 

#### CIP5
> Discussion around currencies. Cardano does multi-asset by having a bundle. Address and tokens two separate entities.  
**Matthias** propose to remove addr in prefixes to keep consistency. Remove reference.  
**Duncan** will get rid of addr_bootstrap because it's confusing (can render a Byron address bip32 style). 



### Discussions 
1. **Frederic** brings up CIP stake pool meta-data concerns in the community. A discussion over badges for ITN pools, a CIP could be written? Just because a CIP is 'Active' doesn't mean implemented.  
2. **F** suggests prioritizing community PRs towards 'Draft' to exemplify community ideas make it through. Ex: "Extended Metadata" [PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15/files).  
3. **D**  (discussing back and forth with SMASH server) mentions the metadata isn't on-chain or at least no link back to on-chain except through the URL.
4. **M**: For CIP structure, would prefer moving to only using the 'Readme.md' file and cutting the 'Cip#.md' file.  
**F**: Aligned - some delays might come due to auto-generated site. 
**M**: Not a blocker. Github keeps track of all.

### Close
**TODO** Invite community members to upcoming meeting (**Frederic**)  
**On Hold** Change Format of CIPs (in CIP 1) (instead CIPx.md)  
**TODO** Probe IOG for promised parameter CIP (**Frederic**)  
(Close)
