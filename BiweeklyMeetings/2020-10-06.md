## Summary

Rough writeup of 10/6/20 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.



## October 06 2020 notes


**Attending**: (Duncan, Frederic, Matthias, Sebastien) + Jeremy (CF) + Shawn (PR Author) + Nick (Community) 


### Triage
N/A

### Last Check  

#### Extended Metadata
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) - potential CIP6)   

**Frederic** - “Extended Metadata” has been awaiting the result of conversations with major stakepool operators led by Markus, while Mike wanted to incorporate suggestions from Shawn. No activity since last meeting on the PR. Recommendation is to merge as a draft as discussed last meeting to start/enable the discussion.  
**Sebastien** - Let’s wait another two weeks for the changes/comments that were expected in the PR to proceed.


#### Curve Pledge Benefit
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/12)  - potential CIP7) 

**Sebastien** - Still not sure if the proposal' incentives are fully sound but that’s for analysts to discuss.  
**Matthias/Shawn** - Last CIP Editors meeting we agreed to merge it as a draft, pending some legal clarifications.  
**Sebastien** - Can be merged as a draft. As formatting goes, ok to merge to advance the conversation.  
**Frederic** - Still no word from legal, but Shawn agreed to remove copyright as Draft and amend the PR while unclear, ok to move as draft as-is and modify.

### Review  












#### Wallet Checksums  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/4) - potential CIP4) 

**Sebastien** - Yoroi extension and Yoroi wallet have already implemented a Wallet Checksum. Maps public keys to a picture and text block: People have often entered the wrong recovery phase numerous times, so the checksum means we receive less complaints (for user errors). This is ready to merge as draft I think. 


#### Message Signing  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/27) - potential CIP8) 

**Sebastien** - When you send a transaction you functionally prove you own the tokens via signing. You should therefore be able to prove any statement, not limited to tokens. 
This is a specification of how to bundle together data (a message) and proof (signature) for a transaction. Agreed format for Yoroi and Daedalus, useful for off chain components. 
The proposed format for how to structure the message is based on COSE, restricting/simplifying a bit the functionalities so it’s easier to use: COSE is a bit too complex for wallets to have a full implementation? The objective is to only support the algorithms that we are interested in using with Cardano. Here, you can submit headers as part of the message. In this specification many of the headers have been excluded. 
Need to check if this approach can be used for Daedalus wallet.
**Duncan** - May have internal IOHK auditors to review, 2-3 weeks needed for review. 


### Discussions 
**Shawn** - What is the process for items to be put on the CIP Editors meeting agenda?  
**Duncan** - Any relevant items, depending on capacity - easiest way is reach out to the Editors or flag it in Github.  
(Discussion re: Pool ranking .. needs to be improved)




### Close
 
**On Hold** Change Format of CIPs (in CIP1) (instead CIPx.md)  
“Curve proposal” (‘CIP7’) to be merged as ‘Draft’, legal tweaks to follow.  
“Extended Metadata” (‘CIP6’) flagged for comments and updates next two week.  
“Wallet Checksum” (‘CIP4’) to be merged as ‘Draft’ in 2 weeks.
