## Summary

Rough writeup of 8/4/20 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.

### Triage

### Last Check
- Merge CIP2 (Draft)   
- Merge CIP5 (Draft)   

### Review  
N/A  
### Discussions
*(short discussion centered around new PRs - from the past two weeks - that should move forward as 'Draft' - we shouldn't be trying to have perfect PRs, rather enable reworking as 'Draft')* 
- Setup a CIP for protocol parameters (Ask Romain? Kevin / Alex) 
- Review Meeting #2 notes in next meeting to continue threads
- Need to upload some version of the notes in the CIP repository for visibility
- should CIP 2&5 add License file and readme? 

### Close
- **CIP1** copy tweaks merged
- **CIP2** merged as 'Draft'
- **CIP5** merged as 'Draft'
