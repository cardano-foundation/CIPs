## Editors Meeting Flow

**Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  

**Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  

**New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  

PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
**Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  

**Issues**: Review of the open Issues on the CIP GitHub 

**Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.

### Triage

#### PR250
[PR250 CIP-0049? | ECDSA and Schnorr signatures in Plutus Core](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/250)

**Matthias** -: Okay. Let's start with Sebastien, and first is PR number 250, which is adding some Schnorr compatible signature to Plutus built-in to get some form of Bitcoin support or Bitcoin compatibility support into Cardano or enable some protocols to move assets from one chain to another to smart contracts. So I think this is pushed by MLabs, but in discussion with Input-Output, in particular with Michael Peyton Jones as well. So I see, Inigo has been commenting on that one for a few bits, but it's still ongoing, I think, the draft.

**Matthias** -: I did a very, very sort of basic review today, and on the surface, it looks good. What's going on? Okay. So I don't have much more comment on that one. I think it's probably good to have it for review or last check for next time, given that the various points are being addressed. I would try to get more maybe buy-in from other parties, because right now most of the work is really done behind those walls between IOG and MLabs, but maybe we could get more people on board on that one.

**Robert** -: You had just recently asked Michael to come back into the discussion, and I think that sounds great to just leave it on hold until we hear from him.

**Matthias** -: Yeah. That was, I think, that the list I had to do. He has commented in the past and approved for the best. I think he has even co-written that. That's why. But yeah, I guess it's just an ongoing discussion happening for signing through to Schnorr, and there is maybe not much to add in the end. That is a helpful one as well.

**Matthias** -: There was one thing I was missing from the rationale maybe, because they mentioned they change a bit the serialization format compared to what Bitcoin uses, which I find interesting or curious, so I will be interested in the rationale, why change the serialization format? That can create some layer of frustration between parties integrating after that. If it's nothing really stands out, then that's probably not a big issue, but yeah. Okay. So maybe we leave it as last check for the next biweekly and see if the discussion settles or not and perhaps advertise that on a few more channels or at least it's here. 

#### PR163
[PR163 CIP-0037? | Dynamic Saturation based on Pledge](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/307)

**Matthias** -: Next one is the dynamic saturation based on pledge. Not sure why we put this one on triage. It's a last-check item, because we've been reviewing that one for a while. I think the last time we agreed to merge it as proposed. Saying it was only missing a path to active, mentioning the last steps were now to get this idea reviewed by the IOG's research team. Important to see implementation feasibility or not. A bit like CIP 0050 and other of the like, so this has been added by the author, so I think we can just move forward with that one and merge it as planned.

**Anthony**-: Yes. It seems like either you or Sebastien would just be able to put it through.

**Matthias** -: Yep. Let me try that. And that one is 0062. Sorry. I have to do that on the phone. Okay. Good. And I will put a note to add it or modify it with me after the call to include that one now. I have no news on that update from IOG regarding a study group for CIP 0050 or CIP 0037 and the likes. So I will contact Kevin Hammond again to see. I think IOG is at a workshop this week, so they won't probably be much responsive, but maybe we can get some form of response.

#### PR309
[PR309 CIP-0038? | Arbitrary Script as Native Script spending conditions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/309)

**Matthias** -: Let's jump then maybe to the two CIP you proposed, Sebastien, last week or two weeks ago, since you are here. Oh, a month ago, actually. Well, quite late. So the first one, CIP 0038, competitively for request number 300-09, arbitrary script as native script spending conditions.

**Sebastien** -: Yes. So basically, the problem is that Plutus scripts are not treated the same as native scripts. These are two different kinds of scripts. The reason there's a difference is because Plutus scripts require phase-two validation whereas native scripts do not. This difference makes it tricky to use Plutus scripts for a variety of reasons. And then on top of that, there's no way to specify datum when you're sending to a Plutus script. It's a totally unrelated limitation to Plutus scripts. So these two problems, as I mentioned earlier, make it really hard to basically compose protocols together in Cardano. So for example, if you're using Catalyst and you want the result of the Catalyst vote to be paid out to your DOW address, you can't do it at the moment, because you can't specify a Plutus script as the receiver of the Catalyst rewards.

**Sebastien** -: So there are a few ways we can improve the situation. One of them, of course, would be getting rid of the requirements that Plutus scripts have to have datum and allowing some kind of default case. But a different way to handle this, which I think is a lot easier and also has the added benefit of getting rid of this collateral requirement in these phase-two issues, is to extend the native script functionality.

**Sebastien** -: Native scripts on Cardano are how you can do basic multisig, and they have as one of their conditions the ability to say, "Oh, you need three out of five public keys to sign this transaction." What we can do is extend native scripts, so you can also have similar conditions on script hashes. So you can say that, "Oh, for this new script to pass, it needs, for example, three of five script hashes to be included in this transaction and succeed." So I think this will make it much easier to use native scripts to compose different protocols together without having to introduce user interface validation you have to worry about and without requiring the presence of a datum.

**Matthias** -: Okay. I'm not sure to fully understand the motivations behind it, because as far as I ... I understood your main point is when you send to Plutus script, you have to send to associate also a datum with it. But surely that datum can just be an empty datum, like a unit.

**Sebastien** -: No, because not every API has a way for you to even easily set the datum. For example, if you're spending through data lists, there's no way for you to add the datum in the spend page. If you're specifying an address in Catalyst, there's no way for you to tell the Catalyst team, "Oh, yeah, and provide this datum." So there are a lot of cases where you can't easily provide this information.

**Matthias** -: Then that's more a problem of software interface than a problem with the protocol itself, right?

**Sebastien** -: Well, so the root problem is that Plutus requires a datum, there's not really any protocol needed to add this restriction, and it is something that we can remove and that I think we should remove as a separate CIP. But as you know, changing Plutus' behaviour is quite a large change in this group of things. And then even if we take this path of getting rid of this default Plutus datum behaviour, there's still a difference in functionality between native scripts and Plutus scripts. So I still think even if we had a CIP like this to get rid of the requirement, it would still make sense to provide this kind of composability feature, both as a Plutus script feature and as a native script feature.

**Matthias** -: Okay. I think I will also take the time to go through the CIP. I haven't really been reviewing that one yet. I see it's had mostly comments from IOG folks. What's been the sentiment so far since Michael's and Jared's?

**Sebastien** -: Yeah. Mostly the sentiment has been nobody's particularly objecting to this. People would prefer to spend the time making the Plutus change to get rid of the datum requirement. I think that's definitely something that's worth doing, but I would prefer if we had both options, especially because adding a new feature to native scripts, as we know, is very easy because we've done this in the past, whereas making a change to Plutus is more involved. And so if we only have that path, it would be also kind of delay the time it takes to add this function to the protocol.

**Matthias** -: Yeah, yeah. This sounds like two separate functions in a way. I mean this would solve one problem while not necessarily preventing this to be also enhanced next to it.

**Sebastien** -: Yeah, exactly. So I would like to have both. The discussion of that CIP is mostly a question of prioritisation, which one should core developers focus on first, but I think that's kind of not really the decision we need to make [inaudible 00:27:05] Mostly, this CIP is just mostly studying it. This is a good idea, if we want.

**Matthias** -: Okay. Jared comments on the impact of extending any native script in that direction regarding the ledger holes and the validation that this would ensure.

**Sebastien** -: I don't recall anything that was complicated about this. I looked at the code myself, and currently, we already have two native script versions because, if you remember, at some point, we added time locks, so we already have native script v1, native script v2, so it'd just be a question of adding in native script to v3 with this proposed change, and it's not a breaking change either.

**Las Safin** -: Hello.

**Matthias** -: Hey.

**Las Safin** -:  Good day, Sebastien and Matthias. I have a few questions with regards to the CIP items. I sort of understand the motivation, because you have the whole issue. I understand the whole issue. You have a datum, and you can't really specify that datum as part of those steps, but that's partly an issue with DApps being implemented poorly and partly an issue with the UX of Cardano being bad. But I don't think this actually solves the issue, because if you have some sort of smart contract, have got funds, and you have it now, and everyone votes to send the funds to some DEX, right, and the DEX just sends the funds back.

**Las Safin** -: Or imagine if it's more automated, you can actually do this, even with this native script thing, because what return address do you specify when you send the funds to the docks, not the docks, to the DEX? Well, you want the native script return address, but how do you compute that? It's a hash. Doing that on chain is certainly possible, but it's very inefficient, and I don't see how this solves the problem, myself. I think this is a problem worth solving. I thought about it myself too, but I'm not sure that native scripts are solutions to the problem. I thought maybe what about just adding datums to the address. That's a bit radical, but what are you think about this? How does this solve the problem?

**Sebastien** -: So the key point is that the native script that you're creating can specify a list of scripts that are required, and scripts in Cardano don't have to be deployed on chain, right? So if you want to add extra logic, like how to handle returning something or handling an error case or whatever, you can generate what the Plutus script for that will be, take the hash of it, include that hash inside one of the native script requirements, and then use that as your native script address.

**Las Safin** -: Yeah. I don't think this solves the problem actually, though. I'll give you all a convincing example. Imagine you have some fully automated thing, and I guess the presence of [inaudible 00:30:25] state machine, it does something automatically. At one point, it wants to send funds to a DEX, and the funds should go back to some other script, and the datum will depend on the current state of the state machine. Maybe we just want to send the state machine to the new script actually, and I don't see any way to do this with this mechanism, because there is no way of specifying what datum you want to send back to. Sure, of course, you can specify-

**Sebastien** -: Yes, there is. So basically you create a Plutus script that takes the datum you want to return to as a parameter. Not a runtime parameter, but parameter in the construction of the script itself, like a template.

**Las Safin** -: But that doesn't work, because you can't check this, you can't check this on chain. Although if you check this on chain, you have to do bit-fiddling, you have to check the content of the script, because there's no way to do the parameterisation on chain in a fully automated manner and fully trust this manner on chain, unless you do the bit-fiddling. Of course, that's certainly possible. It doesn't really solve the problem to a satisfactory level in my mind.

**Sebastien** -: If you know what you want the return address to be at the time the user's generating the address, then this is not an issue. If you want to compute this dynamically, then you'll need to have some more complex interaction for this. For example, you could have the script associated instead of native script require [inaudible 00:32:08] smart contract, which then figures something else later or triggers something else later, and you have to do multiple steps. But I think this is more a question of not being able to do this in one go, and the situation you're describing will require multiple steps of execution, but I don't think that's necessarily problematic.

**Las Safin** -: I mean, you're going to have the problem with necessitating multiple steps and then multiple extra transactions to do some sort of wrapping. But in this scenario, it's a very, very minor step forward, because there are very few use cases where this is actually useful, where you'd have a static return address. In almost all DApp interactions, you need to have a dynamic return where you would ... There are two issues here. You, first of all, want to ... It's like an [inaudible 00:32:58] You want to send state to the return address in the form of datum or something, but you also want the party that sends to the return address.
For example, the DEX sends funds to some dynamic statements being incentivised. This DEX should also be able to specify extra information. And sure, you can do that for tokens, actually, so it's not a huge problem. The problem is you're also specifying the return name. Because this doesn't really solve it, it's a very minor fix. I mean, sure you could, you could just add this and be like, "Okay, we've solved this for one particular use case, but maybe we should think of a more general solution before going ahead with this.”

**Sebastien** -: Well, this has everything we need to basically build proxy contracts for layer twos and side chains, which is the main thing that we want. If you want something more complicated, you'll have to do multiple steps, as we discussed, or you may want to use this other functionality described where we allow Plutus scripts with no datum. But the situation you were describing, I don't think it's not possible. It's tedious. It is possible if you're not-

**Las Safin** -: It is impossible because of the CPU limit. It's [inaudible 00:34:14] handle the concept of the serialization of the script on chain, hash it on chain, then modify it on chain. Sure, it's possible, but it's not really the way we should go. What's wrong with just adding the datum to the address, because the datum, is actually part of the address in some sense from a semantic perspective? What about just making it part of the status life once it [inaudible 00:34:38]

**Sebastien** -: You can have a script, part of the native script requirement list, and this script as part of the native script requirement list says the next transaction needs to contain an output with this datum as part of it. It's not great, I agree, but if you want to specify a datum, arbitrary datum, instead of adding this datum to the address itself, you could just encode the requirement of adding this datum as part of this native script that's embedded into the address.

**Las Safin** -: I think ... Yes, but what about just adding the datum to the address? Would this solve your problems, or would it not solve your problems if we just add the datum to their address?

**Sebastien** -: It would not solve the problem for our situation, but I can imagine cases where this is sufficient for them.

**Las Safin** -: Why would it not solve your case? What do you seek to do? Because if you want some datum action, you just say send to this address, and you specify it as part of the address, and that datum may just an NCA [inaudible 00:36:09]

**Sebastien** -: So this would solve your ... So I guess we would get into the same situation where this would solve our problem if we had multiple steps. Basically, if we did this other option you're proposing, where we had the address with the datum embedded inside the address, you would first be sent to a Plutus script, which in our case would then be a Plutus script that then requires composability within native scripts, which is what we're using. So I guess the solution you're providing solves our solution as long as we're okay with multiple steps as well on our side.

**Las Safin** -: Okay. I think actually I also think of a few other more general solutions, so maybe I'll also write up some thoughts, because I think we can maybe just bring more advanced here. Because I think there's also the more general problem of parameterisation being highly non-trivial on chain, but I think we can actually make a solution where you can parameterise any hash by another hash if we change the serialisation format of pieces of it.

**Sebastien** -: Yeah. So again, I think the solution you're providing falls into kind of the same bucket as the ongoing discussion inside the CIP, which is that there are multiple ways we can deal with composition. Each way has some advantages. The implementation I'm proposing is very simple and solves a certain set of issues. The version you're proposing is also interesting. It solves also some set of issues. There's no reason we can't have both, and so I don't see it as a detriment to this CIP in any way.

**Las Safin** -:  Yeah. Maybe it's fine to have both. I mean, the one question I didn't actually say my answer, it says requires, so does that mean it can be anyone in the script cons? Can it be a state validator, mainly policy, a validator can be anything, or does it have to be something specific?

**Sebastien** -: Yeah, that's a good point. We might want to add extra functionality for you to be able to insert more about where the script hash is. I'm not sure if we want to go that far, because I feel like this kind of goes down a rabbit hole of adding too much functionality. It's meant to be fairly simple. So I would say it is just any script that's part of the transaction.

**Las Safin** -: That's fine. I think that's fine. My concerns are over. I think this CIP to step forward and it's certainly useful, but I think we should also think of a more general solution from what [inaudible 00:39:29]

**Sebastien** -: Yeah, I agree. I think we should definitely increase composability in multiple different ways to handle multiple situations.

**Las Safin** -: Right, thank you.

#### PR310
[PR310 CIP-0039? | Language annotated address](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/310)

**Sebastien** -: And on a related note, we have a second CIP that's also proposed by me that's also partially related to this one and partially related to the discussion we just had, which is CIP 0039 for language annotated addresses, which basically says that right now addresses in Cardano, you can't tell the difference between a native script and a Plutus script. But CIP 0039 tries to set a standard for being able to differentiate between script kinds.

**Sebastien** -: There's two ways that can be implemented. It can be implemented as a purely off-chain construct, and the blockchain itself has no knowledge of this difference, or we could go all the way and implement this as an on-chain construct. The discussion inside the CIP is mostly people talking about how they prefer to have this as an on-chain construct, but there is no clear way to make this an on-chain construct that really works for everybody. And so that's kind of the summary of this discussion.

**Matthias** -: So are you proposing to extend the address type to have new types that can now carry a script in the space?

**Sebastien** -: Yeah, that's the basic idea. So basically, we extend the existing address format on Cardano to annotate them to include the script type used inside the address. But as you know, the addresses are parsed by wallets and these things are not necessarily on chain, and so you could have the wallets take an address, use it to assert the script type, and then strip the script type information to submit that off-chain. I assume that part on chain. So that's how you implement the CIP without having to make any changes to the blockchain itself, which I think is more like the first implementation because trying to change the on-chain format of access is one, complicated, and two, there's really no good way to have the chain really enforce script types.

**Matthias** -: But this is kind of the nature of my questions because you have two options also regarding your address. You can either modify the existing types or add new types that will include scripts, which means that you will still have the ability to use the old address type that does not include the script namespace. So I think this makes it slightly easier to implement in a non-breaking manner.

**Sebastien** -: And I said this back in the CIP. So basically, there are two ways. There's one way of allocating new types, like the [inaudible 00:43:08] numbers, and the other way is to extend the existing types. We can extend the existing types without introducing a new number in the header, and this will work except for pointer addresses. The reason why is, because if you change the existing types, you can differentiate between them based on the length of the address. If it's one length, it's one standard. If it's another length, it's a different standard. This doesn't work for pointer addresses, because they have an undefined length, so there's not really a good way to parse them.

**Matthias** -: Maybe there is a CIP to make here to suggest the removal of pointer addresses, since I think we are amongst the two individuals that have been using them on the chain, the only two. So yeah, that will simplify a bit the things. Okay. Should we get that CIP for review next week? Is the discussion still ongoing? Or I see mostly happened months ago, but no, no-

**Sebastien** -: No, I don't think there's any ongoing discussion anymore. I think everybody has said their thoughts on the proposed path. I think some of the stuff has not been decided for the CIP 0039, the language annotated addresses. Michael Peyton Jones and Jared wanted to try and figure out how we can make this an on-chain construct that is actually validated by the blockchain itself. But then you need some way for the blockchain to know ahead of time whether not an address is a native script or a Plutus script. Or the other option is that if you don't validate this ahead of time, but then if somebody sends to the wrong script type, they can never spend from it, which is also not great.

**Matthias** -: So it could be done fully optionally. So if you specify a type and you provide the script part of the transaction, then the ledger validates it. And if it doesn't validate, then it fails. So as a client, you have a way to sort of enforce that there is a ledger validation on top, but if you don't provide it, then yes, the ledger has no way to validate it. Then it's just blindly accepts it, like it does now.

**Sebastien** -: Yeah. And the question is whether not this validation should have been when you send to the address or when you spend from the address.

**Matthias** -: Well, I would say if you can do it when you send to the address, that's where the interest is at this stage, because that's where I think it can happen right now.

**Sebastien** -: Yeah. That was my preference as well. Michael Peyton Jone's preferred to do the validation when you spend from the address.

**Matthias** -: When you spend from it, you can always do it, because you have the script at this stage. But then what happens if you have sent to an address which has a mismatch between the type and the actual script, you are just locked forever.

**Sebastien** -: Yeah. That's Michael Peyton Jones's suggestion.

**Matthias** -: Okay. That's an interesting suggestion.

**Sebastien** -: Yeah. I prefer to avoid people accidentally potentially locking funds forever, if possible, which is why I'm not the biggest fan of that proposal, but also, I understand that the chance that you get this wrong, you send the wrong script type, is also fairly small. It's not the biggest concern, but I think figuring out which validation we will take if we make this an on-chain construct is the main thing that needs to be decided. But if we're in disagreement about the way we want to do the validation, but we're in agreement on the binary format of this, then we can just make this CIP be the off-chain standard only, and then have another discussion about how to do any on-chain validation in the future.

**Matthias** -: I don't quite see the benefits of doing on-chain validation after the fact on this, because this is really a feature to prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot, and now we are just giving them one more way of doing that if we do the validation after the fact. So if it's purely informative for wallets and applications downstream to be able to identify whether or not a certain asset is locked behind a Plutus script or a native script, then I don't see what validations would add on top.

**Sebastien** -: Yeah. I 100% agree with you.

**Matthias** -: Okay. Maybe to move that CIP forward then is to also decide on how you want to implement that between the off-chain or on-chain. And perhaps it can start, as you said, off chain, having wallets already recognising that format, using it, but stripping the parts when actually submitting things on chain. I think that will be quite hard to get adoption across the entire ecosystem in a way, because now you will also get some discrepancies. Some wallets will show an address, and an explorer might show a slightly different address, which might be very confusing for people. So my own preference would be to have that enforced on chain fully, even if there is no validation or extra validation done yet on top of it. That wouldn't be worse than the current status quo, and then we can take a bit more time to think about how we want to validate that if we want to validate it. That's my thoughts, yeah.

**Matthias** -: Regarding the implementability of that CIP, did you discuss that with Jared also on the PR?

**Sebastien** -: Nothing beyond validation rules.

**Matthias** -: Okay, because I imagine if it's just adding new addresses, it should be pretty straightforward implementation-wise, as it's just extending an existing sum type basically. And yeah, it doesn't introduce new validation logic in that sense. It's just a script address that carries some additional information with it. But yeah, that would be to discuss. I will make a more formal review also after the call, adding some comments on itself. And let's see. Let's have it for either review for next biweekly. See if we can get more insights from the core team as to whether this is implementable and what the plan is.


### Last Check

#### PR307
[PR307 CIP-0060? | Music Token Metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/307)

**Matthias** -: Last check, also, we have CIP 0060, Music Token Metadata, which we reviewed last time. I think we had a few minor comments which were addressed, that it seems. Okay, yes, we're going to need to change the tips, sadly, change the time zone as it's my bad. I suggested to change the type to processes, but it's actually process. I believe that there's no type of ... We can probably do it ourselves. Far as I'm concerned, this one is also good to go. Any comments, Sebastien or Robert?

**Robert** -: I think since they chose all of their metadata items based on meetings that they already had, that part of it seems complete. They also in the discussion thread answered some questions about the scope of the proposal, so I really don't see that there's anything else to do with this other than merge it. That's already the outcome of their own consensus, their media group.

**Matthias** -: Yeah, exactly, exactly. So it's nice of them to actually put that in paper and record it. And well, I still have reasons to, regarding CIP 0025, but since this one is based on safety, 0025 acts as an extension of it. But that's something which is a bit off-topic here. So I would approve, but under the condition that we change the processes, I mean the type from process to process. I think we can do it, unless Andrew Givens has prevented commit from his branch. If he did, then I think he would just modify it. That'd be fine. And also the status, we need to change it to proposed.

**Matthias** -: What would be the best to active in that one, I guess, some of those parties used the CIP. So if this is already in use, maybe we can even merge it as active right away. Also, that doesn't [inaudible 00:13:14]. I'm just commenting on the branch. Maybe if you want to move to the next one, which is CIP 0068.

#### PR225
[PR225 CIP-0068? | Datum Metadata Standard](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/225)

**Robert** -: We don't have any of the CIP 0068 participants here today on the guest list, it looks like.

**Matthias** -: No. They are US based, so they are unlikely to join today.

**Robert** -: Oh, on the wrong time zone.

**Matthias** -: Yeah.

**Anthony**-: So if everybody's happy, I will leave CIP 0068 in the agenda for the US time zone meeting next week.

**Matthias** -: No, no. CIP 0060.

**Anthony**-: CIP 0060. Apologies.

**Matthias** -: Oh, CIP 0060, I think we will be able to merge it after the call once we have done just the two changes we mentioned, fix the type and change the status to either proposed or active, depending on whether or not this CIP is already used by these artists, music industry companies, which is what I'm capturing on the pro-request comments. But I was simply suggesting maybe to move to CIP 0068 in the meantime.

**Sebastien** -: Keep in mind that for CIP 0068, it depends on CIP 0067, which had a non-trivial update last week.

**Matthias** -: CIP 0067, the label registry, right?

**Sebastien** -: Yeah.

**Matthias** -: Yes. So you want to work us through that bit, Sebastien?

**Sebastien** -: To be honest, I haven't had the time to read through it all.

**Matthias** -: Okay. So should we keep then CIP 0067 for review for the next bi-weekly call and CIP 0068 in the meantime, because they both go hand-in-hand, basically? Is that what you're suggesting?

**Robert** -: Yes. For the USA-friendly time zone, that sounds like it would yield a better discussion.

**Matthias** -: Yeah. I think CIP 0068. It's mostly European folks behind it in spots.

**Sebastien** -: Yeah, I don't think the US time zone quite particularly helped for CIP 0068. I have no issues as it is, but my comment last time, other than seeing whether or not it gets any adoption, it's just the main thing. Just love to see if CIP 0067 had some changes, but I'll need to review it. But for 0068, I have no issue with it.

**Matthias** -: Sorry. I just finished commenting on this one, so CIP 0068, we'll keep it as review for the next meeting, part with CIP 0067 first to make sure-

**Sebastien** -: [inaudible 00:17:58]

**Matthias** -: What? Sebastien, you said something or ...

**Anthony**-: Yeah, I'm also struggling to pick up on Sebastien's line.

**Sebastien** -: I was saying, Matthias, he is really quiet for me. Is he quiet for anybody else?

**Anthony**-: He's not that quiet from my side, no, but Sebastien, your volume and clarity has just improved quite a lot for me.

**Matthias** -: I try to increase my volume maybe a bit, Sebastien.

**Sebastien** -: Way better, way better.

**Matthias** -: Okay, good. So I was just saying CIP 0067 and CIP 0068 for review for next time. We'll go through CIP 0067. There is, I think, already quite some discussions happening on this one, although it's happening in various places. So yeah, probably they've got enough attention. We don't necessarily need to bring more people into the discussion, particularly CIP 0068, which has been going over a lot in a lot of chats. Yeah, okay. So I'll keep them for next time then.

### Review 
### Discussions

#### PR242
[PR242 CCIP-0050? | Shelleys Voltaire decentralization update](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/242)


**Matthias** -: Okay. So I would say we have about 10 minutes left, so that gives us a bit of time to go through maybe CIP 0050 and some updates on the discussions there. I haven't been following the latest items on that, so I'm not sure if any individual has. Robert, maybe.

**Anthony**-: I'm not getting any audio from Robert. Is it just me?

**Matthias** -: Yes, I do hear you, Robert, but I think Anthony doesn't.

**Robert** -: ... there was hope for, because it's been up for so long, it's become a magnet for proposals that are similar that are coming in and out of the CIP 0050 thread. So there has been commentary, but not really about CIP 0050 itself.

**Matthias** -: I think it was a bit the goal of CIP 0050 also to become the hive mind, as Michael calls it, right, [inaudible 00:53:46].

**Robert** -: Yes.

**Matthias** -: Welcome discussions on incentives, rewards, and how to do better with an initial proposal, but not necessarily the finite proposal, being CIP 0050. I mean, it will be eventually, but it might be vastly different from what was initially submitted. I think that was kind of the idea.

**Robert** -: Yes. And one of those that we just recently merged without the meeting was sort of a really quick and dirty way of dealing with the problem just by a linear relationship between pledge and saturation, something that would work for some centralisation cases, but allow others. So I think we're still looking for something that is going to deal with the civil attack problem and the centralisation problem, all in a nutshell. It's a bit like the grand unified field theory. Everyone has an idea how to tackle a different part of it, but it's hard to put the whole thing together. So since the author is a scientifically rigorous person, it seems to be a theory that hasn't promoted any particular practical application yet. People are still talking about different ways of doing it.

**Matthias** -: Also, new participants in the discussions recently, which is interesting. Okay. So I guess we'll also need to go through a bit about the discussion that happened on GitHub, and also this call, try to make a summary for next time and see. And as I said earlier in the call today, I need to reach out against you, Kevin Hammond from IOG, to see if we can get any more attention from IOG researchers. It would be very nice to get more collaboration on that in an ongoing effort with milestones and actually actionable items a bit. I guess they have Vasil now plans to be held out for September 22nd, so that kind of topic should be next on the pipeline, hopefully.

### Issues
N/A

### Close 

**Matthias** -: Okay. I think it's a good time to wrap up maybe. So I will try to do that. Let me pull back the agenda. Yes, we've been through CIP 0049, candidate CIP, which is adding two new primitives to Plutus to verifying Schnorr and ECDSA signatures, which would bring some form of Bitcoin compatibility into Cardano. It's been mostly discussed by IOG and MLabs. It's in good shape, so we'll have it next time for review and last check.

Then we've finally merged CIP 0037 as proposed, although this is a CIP that falls in the same category as CIP 0050, discussing rewards and incentives. For Cardano, it has different pros and cons as discussed in CIP 0050. So this was more a way to put the closure on that discussion on CIP 0037 to also move it more to the more general CIP 0050 discussion.

Then we've had a last look at CIP 0060 for the music token metadata, which was already reviewed, discussed, and it was really just a last sanity check. We agreed to merge it. We fixed the typo in the type and changed the status to either proposed or active, depending on whether or not industry members are already using it extensively.

We've postponed the discussion on CIP 0068, because it needs to go hand in hand with CIP 0067, and we haven't really got enough time to go through that CIP 0067 recent update. So we'll have both as review for next week, sorry, for the next meeting I mean.
We have discarded CIP 0045 and CIP 0066 from the discussion from the agenda today, because there have not been any substantial updates since last time we discussed them, and we instead looked at CIP 0038 and CIP 0039, which sparked an interesting discussion during the meeting and specifically on how do we maybe improve a bit the overall UX surrounding scripts on Cardano and, in particular, how do we prevent users from shooting themselves in the foot when sending to script addresses.

So CIP 0038 proposed one way to alleviate some of the problems or some of the difficulty that there is currently with the usage of Plutus scripts and datums. The discussion was now to move forward, we wanted to make a decision on how we want to enforce that, on chain or off chain. On chain, meaning that this requires some buy-in also from the core teams to implement.

CIP 0039, which is more on the side of addresses and how do we improve address. Sorry, I mixed them both. So on chain versus off chain discussions is on CIP 0039, and CIP 0038 was about the extension of the native script to introduce validation of Plutus scripts as the next type constraint, possibly many if combined with the existing primitives of the native scripts.
I think that was it. So thank you all for joining and see you in two weeks.

**Sebastien** -: Thank you.

**Anthony**-: Thank you, everybody. Just a short note, Matthias, that the next CIP will take place next week, just because this was a delayed CIP.

**Matthias** -: Okay, sorry.

**Anthony**-: Okay. No, just to clarify.

**Matthias** -: Next week then.

**Anthony**-: All right. Thank you.

**Matthias** -: Cheers.
