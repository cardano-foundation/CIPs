## Summary

Rough writeup of 9/7/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.  

## September 7 2021 notes 

**Attending Editors**: Matthias Benkort, Duncan Coutts, Sebastien Guillemot, Frederic Johnson. Community Editor Robert Phair.


### Triage  
#### Pool Operator Verification  
[PR102](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/102) - “Pool Operator Verification”  
**Frederic** - There was a request for cryptographer review and Inigo jumped in.  
**Duncan** - I agree with Matthias - Inigo seem happy to proceed, will add my tick to this.  
**Matthias** -  I suggested to merge PR102 as 'Active'.  
**D** - Do you know if the solution that is proposed here notes that the VRF keys can be updated (that they can be updated whenever users re-register)  
**M** - That's technically a new pool isn't it? So I mean, from the perspective of the CIP, it'll need a new "registration". Updating the VRF would require to go through the "verification process" again.  
**D** - Not, it's not a change of identity, the hash of your cold key is your identity . The VRF is one of the hot keys. I'll approve but will add a comment in there to clarify.  
**F** - Do we want to set it up as active as per the comment request?  
**M** - 102 could be merged as _Active_  
**D** - Fine with it as active, if it reflects the reality that's fine by me.  
**Robert** - Active works.  
=> Merge ASAP  

#### Meeting Notes  
[PR123](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/123) - changing meeting notes naming convention  
**D** - Adding green tick.  
=> Merged  


### Last Check   
#### HW Wallet signatures  
([PR107](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/107) - "Restriction on transactions signed by hardware wallets")   
**D** - Overall this is sensible, enthusiastic about this going into a CIP - it started off about canonical CBOR and is now becoming about interoperability between HW wallets and such - I added a few comments in the PR.   
=> Merge ASAP  


### Review  


### Discussions  
#### Informing devs  
**Robert** - when CIP items are done, we should aim to quickly call attention to it in the "CIP Corner" in the IOG Marketing newsletter (if people haven't seen it before).  
**F** - I am working with Lenna Onto from IOG to get a stronger presence in that email wrapup, point taken.  

#### CIP Statuses
**F** - The greater conversation has been about the process for CIPs, for when we bring them onboard the repository,as we bring them as 'Draft' and functionally there should be steps to progress them from 'Draft' to 'Proposed' and onward (you can see the steps in detail in CIP1. From side conversations that have occured with Matthias, he suggests that it might be helpful to rework how the flow currently happens so that the merging in the repository implies some acceptance. I believe Matthias is proposing we leave the PR setup as 'Draft' in itself, (so skip the 'Draft' Status) and rather redefine the merging as an implicit 'Active' or 'Proposed' Status. My personal opinion on this is that this will lead to issues down the line. I see the CIP platform as a place for individuals to jump in and agree/disagree but also harder to do if we were to leave PRs as 'Draft' (and implicitly establishing the merging as 'Active') is that when people discuss they would then be discussing PRs themselves as opposed to CIPs themselves. I feel this would make the conversation more obscure or obtuse. I do feel the Formalism right now might be overkill, but might be very much required down the line. Yes, it would be easier to move everything to 'Active' now but would probably become a hindrance later.  
**D** - I do not have a strong view on this 'Active' or 'Draft' conversation. Happy to move along either way.  
**F** - I feel these are important conversations that will come back in the future and that we might be taking shortcuts moving too quickly towards 'Active' for CIPs. On the other hand, there were vocal complaints about the CIP process being too slow. Still the risk (in setting too quickly to 'Active') is that people would be frustrated at observed "non-implementation" (on IO's part). The CIP is an ANCILARY process setup for visibility, not a DECIDING process. I feel that disconnect is there no matter what. And the 'Draft' status emphasizes that distinction. So (when we have a MERGED CIP with a 'Draft' status) we can point at it and tell people that "it is a 'Draft' proposal => it has not been implemented yet and there is no expectation of that happening". Meanwhile an 'Active' status CIP: it should have a colllection of specific adoption criterias that have been observed => Objectively verifiable. And then we can say "ok, it was proposed with those acceptance criteria, we observed them and it should be moved to 'Active'". For a Standard such as the CIP-0025 ("NFT Metadata Standard") maybe the proposed "observable criterias" could be that 'X implementations' follow that format. It's an extra hoop for people to jump through but the formalism might be useful: I feel we need something in-between ('Draft' and 'Active' statuses). I don't know if we have a clear (way) to make this (distinct) enough, so people understand that 'Active means one thing' and that we also have criterias that are objectively verifiyable.  
**D** - If we don't have consensus on these kinds of process changes, we should probably hold off on those.  
**R** - I think both views are fine with arguments either way. My Q is "Are the people outside of standards commitees going to have any input regarding the decision for shifting a proposal (from a Draft Status) towards 'Active'?" -> What is the process regarding determining which proposal makes it to active assuming all criterias have been met?   
**F** - Entirely up to IO - the 'implementer' really (whoever is implementing the proposal) - If we were talking about a wallet standard, then it might be according to whatever wallet implementers might decide. For Example a Wallet Standard CIP could be considered 'Active' if there were 10 wallets that enable it... Or something like that.  
**R** - So that intiative doesn't go in the CIP process - It applies to the party that is implementing that Standard.  
**F** - CIPs are not Standards by default, they are formalized suggestions for people to align on. Some of them might be Standards (some others might become standards 'down the line'). There are no Standards commitee, Editors are simply trying to clean things out and curate so the community can have the conversation and decide how they choose to proceed. I feel it would be fair of Matthias to push a PR change, so we can discuss further changes for CIP-0001. I think modifications are needed, but generally speaking there is a significant disconnect between the community's **understanding** of the transition from the conversation phase to the onchain implementation and the actual implementation.
