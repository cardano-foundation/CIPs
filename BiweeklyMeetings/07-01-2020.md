## Summary

Rough writeup of 7/1/20 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.



## July 1 2020 notes


**Attending**: (Duncan, Sebastien, Frederic, Matthias) 



### Triage
- Nothing to review yet!
### Last Check
=> **Action**: - merge PR (CIP1 copy tweak)
### Review
#### CIP2 
> (Discussions already took place in that PR comments!)  
> A few items to change for the current CIP2 PR   
> Missing the fee - Description is wrong… Should the termination condition incorporate the idea that some inputs might be too small to spend? Or should it be part of the available  condition UTXO or Ignored (a choice) 
Add a query about if the algorithm is clear in presence of a min UTXO output.. (was it considered for Byron?)
> Possibly: remove “for Cardano” from the title  



### Discussions
- Side conversations for how the Wallet work for Shelley key derivations (currently on the Adrestia user guide, might be worth moving to the CIP).   
- Other Qs regarding transaction Metadata (format allows for wide-range)...  
- (could/should be freeform?)   
- Describe a way of versioning metadata?   
- Need some agreement on namespace else it might lead to confusion.  
- CIP notes should be merged in post meeting in the CIP Repo - will be fleshed out in the coming week.  


### Close
- CIP1 Copy tweak PR - to merge asap.  
- “Coin Selection Algorithms” PR agreed on, to be merged in as CIP2 ‘Draft’ if no issues next meeting (7/15)  
- Meeting notes (these) to be added to the CIP repo itself for visibility on process.
