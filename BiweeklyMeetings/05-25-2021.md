## Summary

Rough writeup of 5/25/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.  

## May 25 2021 notes 

**Attending Editors**: Matthias, Sebastien, Duncan, Frederic. Editorial Guest: Robert Phair.  


### Triage  

#### Followups
([PR66](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/66) - "Fair Min Fees")  
([PR21](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/21) - "Non-Centralizing Rankings")  
**Frederic** - There have been some updates yet both PR are still with IOG Research. An update from Colin: he believes the mechanisms described in both CIPs to be "fit for purpose" and that these are now with the research team at IOG for review. Roman himself reviewed and reached out to Chief Scientist Aggelos, and is awaiting replies due to everyone pretty busy with Alonzo and other releases right now.  
**Duncan** - I know the research group has been pretty busy with getting the A0-related things ready. I want to add that it isn't necessary to wait: we have always said that it is OK to publish technically self-coherent sufficient proposals: they don't have to be agreed or approved by IOHK research or other - really the choice should be with the original Author of that CIP, if they choose to wait for review or push for publishing. Reseach or review does not have to be a blocker for publication.  
**Sebastien** - I feel bad that we're leaving this open but I am not sure that there is a better option really.  
**F** - I would be more inclined to try to merge this (due to community feedback).  
**D** - Just as long as we make it clear that the publishing has no implication/expectation for the implementation.  
=> Loop back with authors re: publishing and update.  


### Last Check   

### Review  

#### Cardano Delegation Portfolio  
([PR82](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/82) - potential CIP-0017: "Cardano Delegation Portfolio")  
Joint conversation with 86 - see below.       
#### Cardano URI Scheme   
([PR86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86) / Update to CIP-0013: "Cardano URI Scheme")   
**Robert** - (re: [PR86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86)) The gist of the conversation is already present in the separate threads really: We're not looking at competing proposals: we want to find out how portfolio links are made, so they can define delegation to more than one pool (here as a json file), we want to make sure Standards are as simple and consistent as possible. I personally think people will want to use decimals to define delegation proportions. Then there's the question of precision also. It's a matter of user expectation/preference. In the long term it might be more difficult to have a more confining standard (that users would want to use with more variety). (This should be documented in the conversation github threads themselves rather than in meeting notes, or at least in BOTH places). I've observed with how people try to use these features in the internet landscape and they try to use it very flexibly - so unless there is a very specific reason to restrict these things from the beginning (ex: something would fail if not), I suggest making the standard as open and flexible as possible. I kinda split my comments into what would be more needed in a linking scenario ([PR86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86)) while the feedback on decimals is more in Mathias' [PR82](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/82). Some of the way that this was framed was due to uncertainty about precise staking ratios if at all achievable. As Matthias noted, that is a separate issue, but as it hasn't been decided one way or another it would be good to keep the standard more flexible to allow for have it not be confining later.  
**D** - To your last point, do you mean "specify the ratio any way we like" and the implementer is to handle it as they choose/approximately?  
**R** - That is what I was trying to get in my comment. Another thing I picked up is the need to have more engagement from the community. Both Matthias and I have our sides of how we feel pretty comprehensively detailed in the threads themselves - so we really need to have more engagement from the community directly - maybe IOG could raise the issue with SPOs since they would be the ones managing delegation portfolios? (Maybe it might be serving a private interest of sort re: "not discussing it" yet..) I think that dev channels or SPO digest should ask "If you could link to your stakepool, how would you like to do it?" (could link to the forum posts or github threads?) this would gather community feedback including the impact on members, how they think delegators would be affected due to the imprecise nature of delegation due to the UTXO model... all to get some more consensus on those items.  
**D** - If what you are suggesting is "more feedback from SPOs", let's get in touch with Ben O'Hanlon and get him to help us with getting it as a topic in the next SPO group meeting: This will be useful to collect the feedback/opiniong from SPOs.  
**R** - I think Ben became SPO community manager around October of last year, that's when I put out the original standalone CIP I had before it was merged with Sebastien's - I was unable to attend those "townhalls", I find them a bit overmanaged, where SPO can interjects to their own comments - they feel a bit one-directional.  
**D** - That is certainly true for the events, community discussion is more for forums or telegram groups. I will speak with Ben next week.  
**R** - That kind of visibility (where I could keep it semi-technical) for the audience would help with engagement.  
**D** - The current schedule I see a SPO comm scheduled for next week - so will try to push for it.   
**M** - My 2c on that conversation - the whole portfolio-decimal-thing - I think it escalated a bit more than the proposal itself: The proposal initially was covering existing capabilities of the Cardano Blockchain, not making any assumption of what might end up in the ledger or in the protocol in the future, but really how wallets TODAY can represent multi-delegation portfolios, assuming that this multi-delegation is entirely done on the wallet side (no protocol change required to do that) it's really just a way to represent having  multiple stakepools, which is achieved by having multiple stake keys in the walley and delegating to multiple pools. So the entire discussion about "what should happen if it ever gets supported by the node" is like a completely different conversation... and at that hypothetical time I think it would be ok to obsolete this CIP and move to a separate solution using native multistaking (if there is even such a thing).  
**D** - I missed the conversation about fractions - Was that the "weights as integers or decimal numbers"? (and really they are equivalent as you could use integer ratios)  
**M** - My pt is that Integer is simpler, while decimals provide a false sense of precision. Really the precision is absent from this entire proposal setup UNLESS we have that native support at the protocol level - But currently from the way wallets will implement that it will be imprecise (so having just integers is simpler..)   
**R** - For cases where users might still prefer to conceptualize using decimals anyways, I documented my comments in the [Github thread](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86#issuecomment-838550989) - looking at the marketing rather than the technical rationale, including how an architect or implementer might choose to consider it.  
**D** - I think the nice thing about Weights is that they don't have to add up to 1.  
**R** - Right and if I were to want to have my pool to get a 50% boost I could just set it to 1.5 if all weights were at 1. But you need a decimal for that. I'm happy to continue conversation where required.   
**D** - I'll go over this with Ben next week and will plug you into the SPO meet for feedback.  
=> Duncan to follow on this with Ben, Robert to possibly open the conversation with SPOs.  


#### NFT  
([PR85](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/85) - potential CIP: "NFT Metadata Standard")  
**M** - The "NFT metadata standard" we've already discussed a few times - There have been some more discussions since last time we discussed. To summarize, this is a standard to summarize some metadata for NFT, at the moment of "minting" the NFT. The initial proposal was suggesting to put all the necessary metadata INSIDE the trasaction metadata (minting the various tokens) according to some given format. The conversation happened around "what" metadata should be included and what the format might be. The initial proposal was more tailored towards image NFT but tentatively opening up to more general kinds of medias. Eventually it was also suggested that storing metadata on chain was a poor move - the Blockchain being better at storing hashes (and storing the content elsewhere). Some conversation followed around using the IPFS network for storing the actual content and using the transaction metadata to link to the content itself. The idea was to store the JSON structure of the NFT metadata on the IPFS network (name, description, mediatype.. ) while on the Cardano blockchain would be a "link" to that location. Since then, some responses have occured (going over onscreen). A lot of good things noted, converging towards "offloading the actual metadata content to other (different) networks". Right now this CIP hints at IPFS - but really this CIP might not require IPFS specifcially and be open to use other storage network. The good thing is IPFS is addressable and verifiyable at the same time. The structure itself could be "free" or specified in a different CIP than this one. This one then would be about "how to get metadata" but then we would have other (possibly competing) CIPs focused on specific types of netadata, ex: NFT audio file or NFT image, or NFT Legal contract... Allowing for various different formats and it would be up to the applications consuming these formats according to the format they align with/by. This would be very much how "mediatype" works on the web - where you fetch a particular ressource, obtain the mediatype, which then lets you interpret the bytestream from whatever server you're fetching that resource (ex: a PNG image). Here you'd get "some" metadata from the link, anf the link itself tells you what type of metadata that is, and if your client can interpret/consume that type they are free to manage it as desired (or report an error if unable to or other).  
**F** - The last comment seemed about spliting it in two (CIPs) - this one about "obtaining" the metadata and the other about identiying the varied types/structures. Without updates from the CIP Author since, this might be tabled despite the conversation..    
**R** - If the scope of this "NFT standard" was as broad as some of the participants would want it to be, schema.org tags could be used. Not sure where the best place for that vocabulary would be though - just that the vocabulary might be used/useable at some future time if the CIP remains general.   
**Roberto** - Completely agree with Robert, I have been pushing the conversations towards schema.org way of representing assets/events - not just about NFT metadatas but so that any metadata stored onchain becomes a bit more explicitly defined - so that it becomes "web-semantic friendly". These metadata standards would be good if we pushed metadata to be stored externally and explicitely call metadata URL/URI so it's clear we don't expect a json object on that key. (+ agreeing re:metadata Schema URLs comment)   
**M** - Really scoping this CIP has been a URI to a particular metadata file and probably rely on Schema.org and provided schemas here to describe varied media contents types. This should already be quite complete to cover a lot of usecases. But also quite large in a way: some projects might want to restrict the space, but should be fine.. (ALSO a good example of why "storing this onchain" is a a weak idea - there can be a LOT of metadata later on).  
**Clark** - the problem with most metadat ais that offsite requires a caching layer and multiple http requests to display   
**M** - But what's the cost a of a http request compared to making the chain 10 times bigger? We won't really get rid of the cost of fetching data.   
**F** - How to proceed re this CIP then? It has been in the background for some time. Alexandro commented in there that he'd be willing to split it or rework it..   
**M** - Currently writing a few suggestions to move this forward and check in with Author to see if he agrees on the varied pts.. Let's wait for updates before setting it back to "review" for the follow meeting.   
=> Adding a note in the PR - moving things out
