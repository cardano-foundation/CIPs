## Summary

Rough writeup of 8/17/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.

### Triage  


### Last Check   

#### Collateral Key Derivation
([PR104](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/104) - "Collateral key derivation")  
**Sebastien** - Based on discussion, it looks like one of the ways we could avoid making too many reorganization Txs, is to allow tokens to be included inside collateral inputs - which means that there would also be a need to specify collateral outputs... This would make it that much easier to include transaction in the collateral, but I am not sure that anyone is actually working on those ledger changes for this because the HF is so soon.  
**Duncan** - It certainly will not be included in the next HF. The point of that discussion was that if it there was consensus (that it was a good solution) it could make it in the next HF (Babage) but that consensus has not been reached from my point of view. When I did bring it up internally, the folks from the Deadalus wallet / wallet backend team did not think they would particularly benefit from it. I proposed that idea as an alternative to this and if you think it is a good idea, perhaps you can help make a bit more noise about it / clarify or argue that we should add it to Babbage. But there is certainly no time for the Alonzo HF.  
**S** - For this specific idea, I have mixed feelings: it's slightly hacky, doesn't solve all cases but alleviates some of them (so it's not a "Bad idea"). I feel that if we were to go down that route it would have made more sense to create some equivalent to the rewards account that could optionally be used as collateral if wanted, so a collateral address could be a utxo address or account-style address, and then account-style address could have tokens in some way shape or forms. But that seem like way too much work to solve the problem..  
**D** - Also it wouldn't work in general because you need at least ONE UTXO per Tx that gets consumed (for replay protection). We don't really want to go down the acccount-route style for a full hybrid thing... No particular demand for that.  
**S** - I don't think there is particularly a path forward for this CIP/PR, we could mark it as 'Rejected' and move on, leave it up for others to dig into it?   
**D** - I think we wouldn't want it rejected as it is a perfectly self-contained well formed proposal. I guess you might choose to withdraw it as a better solution rather than rejecting it. We don't reject it as editors. I suggest you continue this discussion with IOHK's Wallet backend team: if you can come to consensus that there is agreement on, then it becomes easier to argue for.  
**S** - Vaccuum labs said that one of the benefits from this approach would be for HW wallets, because we'd like HW wallets to be able to validate how much collateral is being inputted into their transaction. But they mention they see no good way to do that, because transaction endpoint don't contain the inputs explicitly..  
**D** - That's not a solution right? If that's a problem  HW wallet have in general (because it's not just for collateral), then they can't verify the input for anything - and if they really want to be able to do that, they can say "we want an extension where any input (collateral or otherwise) can specify an assertion on how much is being spent there"  
**S** - The problem is that to do this you need to add a lot of logic and the ledger app doesn't have enough memory for that. So they wouldn't be able to provide any protection wether or not this CIP is added regardless (because of the memory limitations and the complexity involved).  
**D** - You wouldn't be able to tell how much money is in, even if it's in a 'specially-derived' address.  
**S** - For this PR: This issue will continue to come up so will need to be addressed at some point (Not necessarily through this CIP). If we have to wait for the next HF anyways, we can have more in-depth conversations after we see more onchain activity and see what happens...  
**D** - Just on timing, if you think you want to get something added to a HF which is not completely trivial, any such decision should happen early in the cycle, since the changes going into a HF on the Ledger have to be ready at the beginning, not at the end, due to the need to be formalized etc.  

=> Issue / conversation to continue, this PR tabled  

#### Pool Operator Verification
([PR102](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/102) - "Pool Operator Verification")  
**Sebastien** - This is already implemented. I don't think there are any objections.  
**Matthias** - Everyone approved, looks good. Andrew did the change touching to the CIP number, so all good.   
**D** - Did anyone get a cryptographer to look at the VRF? There is a proposal here about using VRF Crypto, which is not completely obvious to me, which seem exactly the kind of thing where we would benefit from having a Cryptographer looking into it.. I would suggest to get Inigo to give a review from a cryptographist POV.  
**M** - Makes sense, I will reach out to Inigo. We already had a couple of rounds, making sure that people were not signing things that they shouldn't. It should be good but it's good to get a second set of eyes.  
**D** - I am always aware that we aren't expert cryptographers despite likely fair intuition.  
**M** - Agreed, we have a good intuition but that doesn't automatically translate into expertise: Let's make sure that the crypto side is safe and doesn't risk things through the VRF and unforeseen security consequenses.  

=> Requesting IOG cryptographer for review, left as 'Last Check' with merging pending review.    

#### Transaction Message
([PR100](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/100) - "Transaction Message")  
**M** - Same for this PR good to go. It adds a new entry to CIP-0010 plus an accompanying CIP that explains for that purpose/how to use it. It's clear, we run it through a few review already.  

=> Merge now  


### Review

#### DApp connector
([PR88](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/88) - "DApp connector")  
**F** - The last conversation that we had (last meeting) requested further conversation take place in the PR as per Matthias.  
**M** - This long-running CIP aims to standardize the way we can have a plugin or addon for wallets - very much like MetaMask for Cardano -  that would provide some basic wallet functionalities accross the ecosystem for various DApps. The idea is to get some little core plugin that can provide and hold user credentials and provide dappps with UTXOs addresses and preipheral things like signatures on transactions, prompting the user when necessary. This is quite an important piece in a way and something we are trying to get right, and is also concurrently being implemented in the Nanny wallet which is a bit taking the place of a guinea pig in a sense and experiencing first with this particular addon and making improvements as they see need. The last thing in there was actually events to know when the network changes or when you disconnect the addon or things like that - to have events that dapps can register and react to (ex: to adjust UI or other)... That was the last thing discussed. I think the goal for that one is really to come up with an initial foundation that can then be extended. Yt is very much Alonzo-agnostic right now (not touching redeemers, collateral focusing instead on things like Mary wallets, address management and utxos). We've gone through a few iterations already and it is getting into shape, but the discussion is still going on in the PR so not worth discussing here until we have come up with a final draft of sorts: let's first reach a solid draft, ideally before the Alonzo HF, to have a foundation for that and then iterating for the Alonzo features.  
**D** - Given that this is being done as a collaboration between people involved with two wallets, it is likely a good basis for the proposal.  

=> Tabled for now / until it is ready to be reviewed. (Looking for a more finalized draft)  

#### HW Wallet signatures
([PR107](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/107) - "Restriction on transactions signed by hardware wallets")  
**Gabriel** - The main purpose of this CIP is to have some specification regarding what is supported by the HW wallet. It was brought up that the Cardano CLI serializes the transactions in a way which isn't really supported by the HW wallets which can result in different hashes (by the HW wallets) and thus leading to invalid signatures. This CIP mainly specifies restrictions on the translation body elements and some other restrictions to be considered **if a transaction is to be signed by a HW wallet**. I'm not sure if there is more to add, open to questions..  
**M** - I added some as comments in the PR, more general remarks or concerns, nothing really against this CIP itself because it is mainly highlighting what is currently implemented in the various devices. Just "should something be planned ot be worked on in the future?" This is the current situation, but it might not be the one we want to reach in the end. We should continue discussing in the PR - nothing really against merging this as it's capturing the current limitations. But as a followup I feel we could rework some of them.  
**G** - The point is to actually reflect the current state, and so as HW wallets are updated we also update the CIP. As noted in some of the responses, such as update to transaction body, as far as I know it was never meant to be supported by HW wallets, and if it ever is required to be supported it can be added + the CIP can be updated (and the same goes for auxilliary scripts) - we have not really dug into Alonzo yet as HW wallet developers - but if it is required to support it then it can be added to HW wallet and this CIP can also be updated. You asked about the number of witnesses that is limited depending on the TX Body or the number of elements in the TX Body. This is already being changed in the multisig or the script update coming to HW wallet.  
**M** - I think the only points before merging would be the number of Tx elements: it's listed like another similar Tx elements. I think we should make the list completely explicit so there is no ambiguity (even if we have to update it for every era).  
**G** - Yes, I will do that.  
**S** - Is there a library where you can give it a Tx and it tells you if it matches those requirements?  
**G** - We are planning to add this to the Cardanowallet CLI tool. We were thinking of adding an option to transform the Tx in a compatible format, but yes, we can also add an option to just validate the Tx according to the CIP, it would make sense.  
**S** - Transform would make sense also. Probably folks are adding it in javascript or C ... we probably would want this in a Rust library as well - it would be good if there were some implementations to look at as references.  
**G** - We will be adding it in Javascript - I'm a bit confused can you explain?  
**S** - Right now, most wallets use the cardanoserializationlib as part of the rust library. That's what most wallets are using. It would be good if there was a reference implementation so that it can be added to the rust library codebase.   
**G** - Ok can arrange. Or would the Js implementation be enough?  
**S** - That would be enough and can be used as reference, webasembly also could but that might not be an option depending on what you folks are trying to do.  
**D** - Overall this is sensible, enthusiastic about this going into a CIP - it started off about canonical CBOR and is now becoming about interoperability between HW wallets and such - I added a few comments in the PR.  

=> Moved to "Last Check" in two weeks.
