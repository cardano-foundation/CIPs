## Summary

Rough writeup of 12/08/20 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.


## December 8 2020 notes 
**Attending Editors**: (Duncan, Frederic, Matthias, Sebastien). 

### Triage  
N/A

### Last Check  
#### Staking Key Chain for HD Wallets  
([PR37](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/37) - potential CIP-0011)  
**Matthias** - Good to merge and proceed.  
=> **MERGING** now  

#### HD Wallets for Cardano  
([PR33](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/33) - potential CIP-1852)  
**M** - This one actually should be merged first since PR37 references it. It will function as a Hub for all the extensions going forward, such as staking keys, multi-sig wallet keys (using same purpose but different chain)..  
=> **MERGING** now  

### Review  

#### Cardano URI Scheme  
([PR30](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/30) - potential CIP)   
**S** - The issue is there is another multipool wants to merge into this one and have not heard from them, so not sure if we want to merge this and then merge the multi-pool in after - ok with either option. PR25. They were intent on merging into this CIP. Could deal with it later.  
**F** - Could we merge their PR rather than this?  
**S** - This one is ready to go, would be fine as-is.    
**M** - Going through it... There is no existing implementation of that is there..?  
**S** - Yes there is, Yoroi/Extension - the code is opensource  
**M** - Format is good, Grammar fine, we could add it in. Addresses are said to be base58 - we want to add Bech32 in there.  
=> Merge in two weeks  

#### Cardano Protocol Parameters  
([PR45](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/45) - potential CIP)   
**F** - Pushed by IOHK's Kevin Hammond, this is looking at the intial Protocol parameters as pushed in the genesis file.  
**M** - For Mainnet.  
**S** - Makes sense - concerned the actual OnChain version drifts from this CIP but could deal with that.  
**M** - Would like to structure this by Era - which would be easier. It could be something that might be mentionned in the CIP expaining that Parameters can drift.  
**S** - If we can auto-generate this, that would be ideal.  
**M** - It doesn't exist yet as a service if we want to automate it. I like the idea of the CIP however as explanining things.  
**S** - What next?  
**M** - Would require changes: disclaimer, link to genesis file...  
**F** - Doesn't the genesis file reflect the actual parameters as-is?  
**M** - Only at genesis - the parameters themselves can be updated OnChain through a special kind of transaction. To figure out what the current actual parameters are, you basically have to go through the rest of the chain and cherry-pick the blocks that have those special transactions, iterate from genesis and apply changes.  
**F** - Adding this in this PR sounds useful.  
**M** - Could be, also to identify out of those parameters which are updateable, and which are not: for example, the epoch length and slot length are not updateable, but the transaction max size it.  
**S** - I assumed this CIP was if people would want to propose parameters changes - if we want to make this we want to change.  
**Marek** - for this particular CIP I see this as for the *intial* parameters, not sure if this deals with *changing* the parameters.  
**Duncan** - Romain wanted this a a CIP to get feedback on the initial parameters, because they can be changed. While it's still centralized, changes could be made to IOHK through this CIP... I think we should decide amongst ourselves what the best method might be: this as a living CIP or rather people proposing follow-on CIPs. Whichever fits the CIP process better. While we still have centralized governance, give some decentralized input. We're transitioning towards decentralized control. While the OnChain gov is centralized, this mechanism can provide input for that.  
**S** - Prefer this CIP be modified for each changes, and then when a new genesis block is added we flag it here.  
**Markus** - I like to have this CIP for intial params. This should have happened before. If we do it for future changes, then it would be better as a *new* CIP. I agree with Matthias - should be made clear which can be tweaked and which require a HF for change.   
**Matthias** - Do you mean one CIP per Hardfork?  
**Markus** - At least for every HardFork, maybe for protocol updates.   
**D** - This only contains updateable characters.  
**Matthias** - We should add the non-updateable parameters then (of the genesis file)  
**D** - Good idea.  
**F** - I think it'd be easier if kept in one CIP. I think both can work, Markus' option should be explored.  
**D** - Another CIP would enable a fleshed out rationale.  
**Markus** - If we do through PRs for soft-changes and new CIP for Hardforks, then we should rename this one.  
**D** - This CIP should highlight how future changes would be done.  
**F** - This one as Standards might be better as Informational to support the state of things.  
**D** - Advantages are that for "at least this moment" they are proposals, and not enactments. Always the point of CIPs, providing a filter for things that are sensible, so some things might get proposed but other competing ones might get implemented. Let's put in this CIP a Proposed way about proposing protocol changes.  
**D** - Let's propose the changes rather than burden Kevin? Change to Informational & others.  
**Marek** - will work on it.  
=> Review in two weeks    

#### On-chain stake pool operation to delegates communication  
([PR44](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/44) - potential CIP)    
**Marek** - When looking at the communication between SPOs and Delegates from the perspective of the chain, we have 3 main channels, such as Offchain, Metadata-based (ex:CIP6), and for cases where you want to be OnChain. Benefits and disadvantages, but this is verifyable, auditable. I think the format is not as important as to how we will send the metadata. Two ways to send, distinguished by label. I wanted to open it up for discussion, still working on change requested.  
**D** - Why do this rather than a RSS feed... Why want it auditable?  
**M** - We're seeing Phishing on behalf of SPOs for example, the usecase here is for direct communication. So SPOs can ask delegates gradually or with certain ammount of stake. This enables directed communication. Adapools.org does the communication offchain. Cost is a feature, for example wallets could have granular control... Another advantage is the history here.  
Not sure how much this will be used in the future but wanted to cover that space.  
**D** - Seems focused on folks that work on the Wallet frontends.  
**Matthias** - I don't think Darko would have any problem with having multiple CIPs for this, the implementation would fall on my team.   
**S** - I think this is nice to have. I'm not a fan of markdown as too much of a risk sent to wallet. I prefer simpler format.  
**Marek** - I was reluctant to send link to delegators even.  
**Matthias** - For security purpose shouldn't add links. If your delegators knows your pool, they should know where to get your official notfications. The msg pushed by the pool to delegator should be able to say "I am your pool, I have this message, please go see on my official channel for more".  
**Marek** - Because this has a cost associated with it, it might be interested for wallet users also - it disincentivizes the spam from the pool too.    
**D** - Reasonable proposal.  
**S** - let's remove the link part, and merge.  
**Marek** - will do changes now, can do now.  
=> Merge in two weeks  

#### Extended Metadata  
([PR15](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/44) - potential CIP-0006)  
**Markus** - I replied to Duncan's comment in the PR. I reworked the entire proposal and it now includes the basic principles of how to generate a signable verifyable extended metadata. I tried to do with the existing CLI but with ran into error with the existing TxSign. Using a standard json scheme, not existing. The Txfile requires an initial key name (?) type.. We either need to have the cardano type extended or design the scheme for the extended metadata. The second step is the calc. of the hash, tried with shelley stake pool metadata and raw json, error about filesize (>512b)   
**D** - That can be changed.  
**Markus** - Also, outside, I got asked why use this mechanism instead of the Tx metadata to push verification keys and signed Tx OnChain. It's feasible but would require fully sync'd chain and a dbsync instance. If one hasn't, then it's a trust matter.  
**F** - Sounds like a separate CIP - here the title could be clarified. Want this to be merged.  
**Markus** - Let's keep in mind: we need CLI support for this to be actually implemented.  
**F** - Right - Inclusion to repo does not imply it will be imlemented, hopefully support in CLI comes.  
**Markus** - Re: Focus on mechanism rather than content, if we don't include the most important fields for metadata, then pools will be using the existing, and not care. We should offer at least the most important ones.  
**D** - It needs both to be implemented and be used. Let's not pack too much into a CIP, this can be extended once it's implemented.  
=> Merge in two weeks (?)
