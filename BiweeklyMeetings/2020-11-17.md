## Summary

Rough writeup of 11/17/20 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.


## November 17 2020 notes  
**Attending**: (Duncan, Frederic, Matthias, Sebastien) + Colin, Lars (IO) + Marek, Federico (community)

### Triage  
N/A

### Last Check  
#### Wallet key generation  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/3) - potential CIP3)  
**S** - minor column changes being added. Merge Once reviewed by Matthias. 
=> Merge as soon as reviewed  

### Review  

#### Treasury Fraction on actual distributed rewards  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/35) - potential CIP)  
**Lars** - A portion of the rewards pool is UNSPENT every epoch - very early, it was planned to go to the treasury (old scheme) - which reduced to about 50% going to the treasury, so now what is left goes to the reserves, which is good because Reserves last longer with Inflation. The CIP Author however highlighted that this however, means somehow a double taxation setup, where the same coins get taxed over and over. 
The suggestion is to change "when" the 20% go to the treasury, the suggestion is that it not be taken from the pot but rather from the rewards.This was mentionned to Aggelos also who agreed it was a good idea. Might have to adjust the rate to account for the changes.  
**Federico** - exactly - We're proposing that we apply the Tau param on the real distributed reward, not the reward pot itself. Our proposal is based on what we need to change in the specs to achieve that result - so instead of calculating the fractionning at the beginning of the process, we move Tau application on the distributed rewards. Shouldn't be too technically challenging to implement.  
**Sebastien** - Do you specify a percentage in here?  
**F** - No, this is simply a proposition so the conversation can take place. Now, we don't see the big difference we were seeing before. Ex: with the arrival of Binance the ammount of delegated ada went from from 50% to 65-66%. Still, we're experiencing real 30 - 35% Taxation rather than the 20% that is specified by Tau param.  
**S** so next steps is to merge this PR then go to IOHK to look at percent
**Colin** Q in terms of actual calculation: Right now the epoch expansion is kinda scaled by the participation rate. The rewards are as if all the stakes was pledged and received pledge reward. If we just divided through the Epoch reward by 1+a0 parameter... 
(Back and forth about Monetary expansion setup)  
**F** - Tau levvy is applied on reward pot before calculating rewards (+Frederic +Lars)
(Looking at [ledger specs](https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-ledger-specs/shelleyLedgerSpec/latest/download-by-type/doc-pdf/ledger-spec))  
**L** - Page 62. Middle of the page. Jarod ideally the good person to ask (or Philipp).  
**D** - Before the shelley release, we changed where unpaid ada went - to Reserves. It looks like there is a sentence off in there: "The difference between the maximal amount and the actual amound received is added to the amount moved to the treasury" it should say go to reserve, not treasury.  
**D** - Probably correct in the mathematics but not the prose.  
**L** - It says october 2019 which seems old?  
**D** - You're looking at the right version - Delta T1, is the ammount that goes to the treasury. The change to the reserves is Delta R1 and Delta R2. The formal spec is correct, the text is off, should be ammended.  
**F** - The discussion is about the unclaimed rewards, for varied reasons. We want to minimize the multi-treasury taxation. 
**S** - Two pts. double taxation. convo can happen offline. Changing Tau is not a HF event.  
**D** - I agree taking the Treasury percentage at the end rather than the beginning is a reasonable thing, but would also need a HF. Let's get specific changes in the CIP itself and review then.   
(=> To be followed up on structure-wise next meeting, pending added clarifications)



#### Extended Metadata  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) - potential CIP6)   
**Frederic** - Some conversation happened in PR but missing answers/followup  
**Matthias** - I don't think there is any edition problem. I would like to see this merged as a Draft and let the convo continue.  
**F** - I'm with Matthias, would want to move this and let conversation continue as Draft.  
**D** - It's distracting to have contingent conversations about content, easier to start with a detailed mechanism. Then we can add to it incrementally.
**S** - Pushing out to next meeting.  
=> Follow-up next meeting.  



#### Staking Key Chain for HD Wallets  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/37) - potential CIP)  
**S** - This is one of the two CIPs I split 1852 in. This one specifies the key/derivation path.  
**M** - Haven't reviewed. will do until next meeting.  
=> Merge in two weeks pending Matthias review  


#### HD Wallet for Cardano  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/33) - potential CIP1852)   
**S** - The other CIP from 1852. This one is intent as the registry of the different chains used in Cardano. It uses 0/1 for BIP44. For example, If we were to add staking keys, then those would be added here, so we can know which index means what.  
=> Merge in two weeks pending Matthias review  


#### Cardano URI Scheme  
([PR](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/30) - potential CIP)   
**S** - Could be merged ... but nobody has had time to review yet.  
=> Move to next meeting  


### Discussions  
**F** - We tried Crowdcast and reverted to GMeet. Want to push [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) going forward (=> did sync post-meeting: all seem sorted out).  
Had a Github history mixup due to force Push: reminder to be careful, now CIP10 inception only in history from a side reference. Yet want to consider force-pushing meeting notes rather than awaiting reviews, as they keep taking longer.  
Conversation was setup with R. Moore's team to take over the [cips.cardano.org](cips.cardano.org) site for next week. Note that [PR #42](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/42) WILL break the site further, but it will functionally be better flowing due to minor tweaks.


### Close  
**ON Hold** “Curve proposal” (‘CIP7’) still awaiting legal followup  
**ON Hold** [“Extended Metadata”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) (potential ‘CIP6’) - another two week hold potentially merging depending on week convo/Duncan.  
**ON Hold** [“Treasury”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/35) (potential CIP) - no plan to merge but will reconsider  
=> Merge in two weeks: [“HD Wallet for Cardano”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/33) (potential ‘CIP1852’)  
=> Merge in two weeks: [“Staking Key Chain for HD Wallets”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/37) (potential ‘CIP’)  
=> Merge **NOW**: [“Wallet key generation”](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/3) to be merged as ‘Draft’ (‘CIP3’)
