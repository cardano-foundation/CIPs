## Summary

Rough writeup of 8/3/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.

### Triage  

#### MSK Wallets
([PR83](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/83) - potential CIP: "Multi-Stake-Keys Wallets")  
**Frederic** - This was already a last check and was approved last meeting - it is now a matter of gathering the formal number of approvals in github.  
=> Merged as [CIP-0018](./CIP-0018/CIP-0018.md)  


### Last Check   


### Review


#### Collateral
([PR104](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/104) - "Collateral key derivation")  
**Sebastien** - The point of this CIP is mostly to solve two problems: one is the fact that to have collateral readily available for transactions, we need to make sure that the way the wallets pick inputs and outputs is done in a smart way, and we also want that in the case where the user has to rearrange the utxo set, it is done in a way that is understandable to the user - Obviously we prefer them not worry about the internal workings, sometimes there is no choice and we have to make it as understandable as feasible. I feel the easiest way to do this is similar to what we did with internal addresses: create an alternate derivation chain, this time as the collateral address derivation chain. We would make sure that wallets when creating Txs put (have) ada in the collateral address and then whenever they are doing regular Txs, you never touch the collateral address unless if needed (ex: if the user were to send all his ada). This way when wallets need to do Tx - such as with smart contracts - it doesn't require any fancy logic such as having enough collateral etc... In most case it should be readily availlable and that should minimize the number of times where users needs to rearrange Txs. In the case it is needed, it becomes easier to explain why and how: we prompt about the collateral address and user will understand. That's the main motivation. The side motivation prevents/avoid putting a million ada for collateral especially for HW wallets. Probably the HW wallets should tell the users how much collateral they are putting up for Txs. And so we should make sure the collateral is not some absurd ammount (even though that's probably safe). This specification covers this as well as it would enable for wallets to mointor the collateral address and make sure it doesn't have abusrd ammounts in it.   
**Matthias** - Without even talking about risks or mitigating, the conception, it might be good to have a dedicated namespace to put this sort of keys in. Just for the sake of doing the coin selection on the wallet, and also from the user perspective, to be able to report exactly how many ada is available as collateral.   
**Duncan** - With my 'technical architect' hat on, I've already shared my opinion on the ticket - I don't like it and have explained reasons why in the comments. With my editor hat on: it's a proposal, it makes sense, it's self-consistent... it's just that my architect recomendation would be to not do this, not implement this bridge.  
**M** - What are your main arguments against?  
**D** - Summarized in the comments - I don't think we need to create this new concept for users, it's not something they have to understand or ever know about.  
**M** - Sortof: If it is a request for a Txs and it fails because they don't have enough to put up for collateral, what does the wallet say? it's not a fee, it's not a deposit..  
**D** - We already have this situation already, where you may need to do rearrangement within the wallet to spend certain ammonts. This is another situation where the same is needed... it would be unusual. The vast majority of the time users wouldn't encounter this. But occasionaly they might, just like if they wanted to spend something like 99.9% of a wallet and you don't have the UTXOs properly arranged. I don't think it's beyond our wits to figure out some sort of wording to explain that we need to rearrange the coins within the wallets.   
**S** - The case for this happening is really a user wanting to send some ada to somebody yet having NFTs tied to some of the UTXOs. This is already happening (and isn't that rare) and is clearly something we want to minimize. The easiest way to do that is to have this kind of namespace. I think trying to shove this into the coin selection algorithm complicates all the code and does not even give that great results. It's best to avoid rearrangements entirely just through the namespace.  
**M** - Even from a user's perspective actually, it makes sense: in terms of user flow, we first ask for a small deposit as a collateral, that is reserved under this specific space under the key derivation scheme (used by the wallet just for that) and there is no reason why this would ever be consumed if the wallet is doing its job correctly. So it's really like a traditional deposit, like as you'd do for when you rent a place. Except that here it's deposited with the assumption the wallet does its job correctly.   
**S** - The way this proposal is written now does not have the wallet ever automatically add collateral for the user. It is done through an EXPLICIT process, which doesn't have to be the case: there is nothing stopping the wallet from proactively putting some amount in the collateral, because at the end of the day, it's not like it's lost: it's on the side and only spent if there is need. This might be better for the user even.  
**M** - This is even more important for Native Assets, that there is a tendancy to group Native Assets together in a single UTXO. So the number of UTXOs that only contains ada tends to be reduced over time. For users who tend to transact with NFTs and Native Assets they end up with very very dense UTXOs...  
**S** - If we don't have this kind of CIP, this concept of rearrangement would not be a rare occurence but would be more frequent / every other transaction kindof.   
**D** - Over the long term, as you do series of transactions - if we want to make sure we consolidate tokens and have enough UTXOs only containing ada - that's a thing we can do as part of the coin sleection. We don't need to make it a hard and fast rule, but rather something that the coin selection does. Doesn't mean it should be in a separate bucket.  
**M** - There are multiple wallets doing multiple coin selection in their own ways, so having a standard like this would help.  
**D** - The standard could say "you need to make sure you keep things in a specal place"... I think the danger of making it separate is that it's NOT available to the coin selection, and having to  explain that "it's not really in your wallet or really available". Yes, you need to have coin-selection (of different wallets) help to avoid having too many of those rearrangement transactions, but it doesn't mean you should go all the way and introduce new concepts to end users.  
**M** - I disagree - I think users need to know at some point. This is a case here, in the same way we had to mention the stakekees. People were getting confused about the "2 ada fee" despite it being a deposit that you get back. Most users are not aware of how it works. That's normal, you get to learn about it later on. It doens't have to be in your face when you start a contract. If the user tries to spend their ENTIRE wallet without enough collateral, the wallet could prompt them with a message saying "Are you sure you want to do that?" or "This would impact your ability to run scripts/smartcontracts (unless rearrangement)"  
**D** - Soft rearrangement is fine. This would mean you'd have to adjust the available balance. It's always in your face rather than an occasional "corner case".   
**M** - Nothing wrong with breaking down available total.  
**D** - I think that creates more problems / is unnecessary.  
**S** - The question of how to present to the user depends on a lot of things. We could have said that we deal with Internal/External ada balances when we had two derivations then, but everybody chose to consider internal/external as the same for purpose of balances and we can do the same thing here..   
**D** - Because we're trying to create an extraction fee. Users don't want to have to do UTXO managmeent. 
**S** - There is no reason we can't do that here as well (not show the collateral explicitely). The User doesn't have to know about this unless they are in this kind of case.  
**D** - But in once case, it is availlable, and in the other it ISN'T.  
**S** - And in this CIP we would not make it available unless needed.  
**D** - But then that means it IS available. Which means you no longer need separate addresses for it, which is quite different than what this CIP is proposing (and a lot better in my mind) and you wouldn't even need separate addresses: rather a policy for coin selection that typicially maintains enough collateral (if wallets are using it).  
**M** - That's similar to how rewards work: they are in your wallet but are not really available  
**D** - We tried to maintain a simple user abstraction that you have a set ammount of money in your wallet without all this notion of reward.  
**M** -  The same thing could be done for the collateral - because it is located on a separate derivation chain, doesn't mean the wallet can't select that for coin selection.   
**D** - If it is (available), then the need for putting it on a separate address is much much less! If it's completely an internal thing (not what is proposed here) - that is different. It would then seem a bit more unecessary, as if we've introduced a possible inncompatibility (where wallets now have to be aware of this to report totals and balances, where diferent wallets report differently etc..). Making this a policy of coin selection would not change the fundamental compatibility, but deals with the problem more elegantly.  
**S** - Wallets will have to update for Alonzo the same they had to upgrade for Shelley when we added reward addresses.  
**D** - There is no new special address here though.  
**S** - For the new derivation path. In Shelley we had to have all wallets upgrade so as to know about the reward address and its derivation path.  
**D** - But there's nothing like that in Alonzo.   
**S** - From the wallet perpsective it might need if they want to do scripts.  
**D** - I can't think of anything that would require to change the schemes.   
**M** - As soon as the wallet want to spin Plutus Scripts then they would have to acknowledge for the Plutus stuff  
**D** - But then the same wallet would still be restorable in a different wallet just not supporting Plutus Txs. There is nothing that we would need to do that would be incompatible (just adding the ability for ordinary wallets to fund script transations: where the scripts are not in the cell with addressses part of the wallet). It's more like please fund this script for me, and keep things in your wallet. There is no incompatible changes: You need to add functionality in the wallet, but if you were to restore that very wallet, you would get the same exact balance in any (other / non-script / non-plutus) wallet. If different wallets report different balances it would scare people. (Yet, with my CIP Editor hat on:) I think it's self-consistent, clearly explained, makes sense. I should probably not argue too much about it.  
**S** - I think the steps forward from here is I will change the wording on the PR based on my discussion with Matthias, to allow for different wallets to either explicitly show the information to the user and also explicitly show based on the wallet preference.  
**D** - I encourage to think through the possibility of a design where it was just done such as an ateration to Coin Selection as a CIP...   
**S** - The Cardano wallet team has already looked at it and have as an internal document.  
**D** - But if it's something where multiple wallets would benefit on this rather than stepping on eachothers toes, then it would be better as a CIP.   
**S** - Would need to speak with Jonathan on that. Would prefer merging this sooner than later given the Hardfork is only a month away. Given that we don't have that many meetings left before.   
**M** - I want to discuss this offline a bit further due to technical decisions.   
=> Moved to "Last Check" tentatively (might be merged earlier depending on conversation) 



#### DApp
([PR88](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/88) - "DApp connector")  
**Rob** - This is mostly the continuation of what was discussed two weeks ago (see notes). The main things we didn't really cover in the last meeting were issues pertaining to what happens if there were multiple versions of the spec and if later some changes came in, how exactly DApps would be requesting which version of the spec they require and also what happens if there are multiple wallets implementing this specs. I was looking into that and there doesn't seem to be a good solution on Ethereum (besides "don't have multiple wallets"). I posted two possible solutions to that in this PR.  
**M** - We mentioned namespaces last time as a possible solution..   
**R** - By "namespace": do you mean a Cardano object and you would inject multiple properties for the wallets that implement that?  
**M** - Yes, part of the CIP probably, a registry of sorts where wallets can register their own IDs such that they would only inject in that specific namespace ID. Which is maybe a bit harder for DApps to choose a wallet but makes it for better UX. If you have two wallets injected, as DApp you can ask the user which to use and how to request.  
**R** - Yet if the DApp is not aware there are changes to the registry, would it still be able to see all the wallet it can interact with?  
**M** - You can always inspect the Cardano object for Registry key(s). The registry on the CIP would just be for wallet so they don't have conflicting IDs: Just for that sole purpose.   
**R** - That sounds like a reasonbable approach. One of the approaches I considered was to just be injecting the list as an object property, but this works as well.  
**M** - We could also specify for wallets to use UUID v.4 so that there is no conflict possible and no need for a registry. You stick to it for your half-life cycle. That would however mean that we would need some kind of metadata attached here - a schema that identifies a wallet maybe - something with name, version, implementers / whatnot.  
**R** - I guess if someone ever needs some nice UI for choosing a wallet, then someone can create a library that analizes the version numbers and only show the ones that are relevant to DApps or something like that.  
**S** - If we go the registry route, we could even inline the registry with this CIP like we did for [CIP-0010](./CIP-0010/CIP-0010.md) . And just expose it as an  object with a set of keys.   
**R** - That sounds quite simple, I didn't know if that should just be injected or external..  
**M** - There could be a reference implementation in this CIP, and I would even encourage people to follow the specification rather than doing things their own way. Doesn't mean it should be done by you or right now, but this would be a nice track to develop. There are 3 methods to get addresses here: getUsedAddresses(), getUnusedAddresses() and getChangeAddress(). But there is actually no method to get any public key from teh wallet, which I think would be quite useful, to be able to query for any public key at any path, which might actually be more useful than addresses probably, because it's pretty easy to construct from a set of public keys. Knowing which address is in use is useful, being able to generate a change address a bit less: you can do that from a public key so long as you can pick a right key. I would lower down the abstraction layer and instead of working with addresses work with keys directly. So that we can get DApps to generate corresponding addresses. That way, if they want to add a stake part to the address or script they can. They can really construct that how they want.   
**R** - Would your proposed change just be a litteral switch between addresses instead to public keys then?  
**M** - Pretty much, and instead reduce that to only one function  - getVerificationKey(). Working out of the path, enabling that corresponding key.  
**S** - If you do it this way, there needs to have other information on what kind of key it is. There is no guarantee the key you're getting is a [CIP-1852](./CIP-1852/CIP-1852.md)  key. You could pass in the path to the key or something like that.   
**M** - It's a bit closer to how hardware wallets opperate: they don't really make any assumptions regarding what scheme is used (although they use BIP32 as a route for defining the hierarchy) but what path is used (within that hierarchy) is up to the client. Although they provide extra checks to make sure you don't do anything bonkers. That's a bit more flexible but that adds more complexity to the DApp itself, and then the DApp has to know what kind of path it is looking for. So perhaps there are usecases for both: (1) The ability of getting an address and letting the wallet decide what a valid address is. But also have the flexibility (2) to get a verification key for that/DApp (which is maybe more advanced) and know exactly what you are doing with keys.  
**R** - Would it be useful to have an API that (given an address) could return a verification key?   
**M** - Unfortunately not possible - because in an address is a hash of a verification key.. Or do you mean as a the wallet and do a reverse lookup? The wallets keep track of a certain number of keys, so that they can reverse-lookup back an address to a particular key. But that means you cannot ask for an arbitrary address: if the wallet doesn't know of that address there is no way it could tell you about a key associated with the address.   
**R** - I am talking about a wallet-controlled adresses... Because what other addresses would you be returning?   
**S** - I feel there is a usecase for exploring the Public Key. There is also a usecase for providing the endpoints as userfriendly. There will be a need when we get to Alonzo for something like GetCollateralAddress(), depending on how much ada you need it would return to you some  UTXOs with enough collateral ... I'd rather not every role have to implement that kind of thing itself by looking at the account key and figuring out what to do. We may even run in this thing where some alts have varied set of addresses and preferably abstract that through DApps if possible.   
**M** - The conversation should continue, notably on the PR - there are things to say we don't have time to cover. Will add after the call.   
=> Moved to "Review" in two weeks. Rob to adjust PR towards a registry-like solution. Matthias to add comments.


#### Pool
([PR102](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/102) - "Pool Operator Verification")  
**M** - This describes a protocol to authenticate stake pool operators on various websites. There are different tools and platforms today like adapool, adatools you name it, which shows stakepools and will also occasionaly provide some aditional interface for stakepool operators. But there is no clear way (yet) to aunthenticate yourself (as an SPO) and prove that you are indeed the actual owner of a particular pool. This is the problem this PR/CIP is trying to solve, by providing a flow that can be implemented by both an SPO trying to get validation and a validating server. This is a very well-known approach: You have a challenge sent by the server and you have to sign it with your SPO secret key, such that the server can then verify it against your public key, and if you are the owner of that private/public key, you can provide the signature. We made some edits on the protocol to make sure that the server cannot really fool the SPO into signing something else (than a challenge) and there is enough randomness to prevent replayability.   
**F** - Isn't that CA-like or ..?  
**M** - You would have many validating servers if you want - such that PoolTool.io might choose to implement that protocol. The same thing couuld be implemented by other services.  
**F** - So SPOCRA might run one such server, as an external entity?  
**M** - Yes, but this is really describing A flow, not who is doing it... There is also a reference implementation for both the client and the server - and as far as I know this has already been implemented in the CNCLI community tool.  
**S** - I think this is good. Still this is yet another way of signing or representing stuff - I would prefer if we could combined this with the message signing spec (CIP?) in some way. But maybe the message signing spec is more for UTXOs or keytypes and I don't really find it to be super different.  
**Robert** - I think it is good and ready to go. The idea SPOCRA or other party to be involved might be good.   
=> Moved to "Last Check" 


#### issue
([Issue109](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/issues/109) - issues with the autogen site)  
**F** - (issue not a PR) - it seems the autogenerated site is not getting the attention it deserves.  
**Robert** - It might be graphic but it touches to text documents - here [CIP-0003](./CIP-0003/CIP-0003.md)  has a lot of documents in the PR but they are stripped through the auto-gen site - and this was not seen after it was merge - we saw it after the Public website was built. I see we have some other supporting files in [CIP-1852](./CIP-1852/CIP-1852.md)  that we were looking at and they all have relative pathnames to it, and some of them that were added were not detected while the other from the [CIP-0011](./CIP-0011/CIP-0011.md)  was always invalid. This was probably never noticed before the issue was raised. This is affecting more than one post in the CIPs.  
**M** - I don't think the CIP relative links should afftect the CIP but it could be that the website doesn't properly export the files (and only exports the readme). There is also the option of just getting rid of the exported website and sticking to the github website for browsing the CIPs.  
**R** - If that's acceptable for the CF, I think that would be good. In fact I think it even gives them a barrier, and the perspective that things are read only. But seeing things on Github projects that they can get involved, even after they have been pushed.  
**M** - And the benefit we get is that it's all markdown - we get maybe a slightly nicer interface. Would even propose we rename all the CIP files as "Readme" by default - which WOULD break the existing system and the site export. If we get rid of that it would make Github the default UI for navigating the CIP in a quite friendly way.   
**F** - Maybe pushing this out to the later roadmap for the CIP program we're fleshing out - creating a Jira ticket for this. Renaming might be an issue. Getting a community site auto-pulling from the current repo would potentially be good. Up in the air on this one.   
=> ading a Jira ticket and potential Roadmap

#### Message
([PR100](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/100) - "Transaction Message")  
**S** - The spec is simple, nothing technically wrong with what they did, people wanted it: I don't see a reason not to merge it.  
**M** - Fine by me. Seem sensible and already being used.     
=> Moving to "Last Check" (correct and in use) 


### Discussions  

**M** - Hoping to move the Wallet DApp connector PR. It would be good to settle on a design so that when Plutus lands we have wallets ready to cooperate. Yet the DApp PR only covers very basic wallet stuff, and with Alonzo coming there are new things coming in and we'd want to get done by a DApp connector likely like script validation and collateral allocation and this sort of things. It's a good start but will not be sufficient and should be updated for Alonzo.
