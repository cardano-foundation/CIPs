## Summary

Rough writeup of 01/12/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow
- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.


## January 12 2021 notes 
**Attending Editors**: Matthias, Sebastien, Duncan, Frederic.  

### Triage  
N/A

### Last Check  
#### Extended Metadata  
([PR15](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/15) - potential CIP-0006)  
**Frederic** - Some minor asks. It doesn't look like much has happened since last meeting.  
**Duncan** - It's not something someone could implement unambiguously yet, because it's not described unambiguously.  
**Sebastien** - There seem to be no rush to merge as-is. The asks in the comments are rather straightforward, recommend they be addressed prior to merge.  
=> Ping @Gufmar to address final tweaks on Github.  

#### On-chain stake pool operator to delegates communication  
([PR44](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/44) - potential CIP-0012)  
**S** - I feel the protocol described is fine to merge as-is from a tehnical perspective and fine as-is. There were some concerns regarding format, but my suggestion was to go for the simplest thing possible. I feel that's done, so happy. Only point unclear was about the uncoding for the data - the encoding used is UTF-8 - probably not the optimum way to pass long data - we could use CBOR to pass it on in a more optimized way.  
**Duncan** - He's suggesting an array of text, each one at most 64 bytes... What would be the advantage of anything else (other than UTF-8)? I would keep it small.  
**S** - Visually (UTF-8 encoded in Base64) would be smaller, but would be bigger at the byte level. I feel it adds complexity but no significant advantage.  
**S** - Also I notice there is a conflict on the PR. They are modifying the master readme... Do we want to encourage authors editing the master readme file to add themselves? This wasn't part of CIP1...   
**D** - I would say no. It will always cause more conflicts than it serves. (Fixed the conflict.)  
=> **MERGING** now  


#### Cardano URI Scheme  
([PR30](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/30) - potential CIP-0013)  
**S** - Matthias looked at this a while back - no objection I think  
**Matthias** - I did then, it hasn't changed since December, is fine.  
**S** - There was a request to add Bech32, that was done. I want to move and merge this, will add number now.  
=> **MERGING** now  

### Review  

#### Shelley Protocol Parameters  
([PR45](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/45) - potential CIP-xxxx)   
**Kevin Hammond** - I updated this propsal and included ALL of the changes since Shelley into it. We now have a record for all param changes, appart maybe for 2.1 which may be mythical...  
**D** - Did we establish (from Sam) re:one?  
**K** - I can keep checking.  
**Frederic** - Did we come to consensus wether this should be era-specific?  
**K** - Up to Editors. What the Auditors wanted was a record of the initial settings, so the community can use that to base changes off, here was the rational for the choices for those params. What you're requesting is a chain tracking the changes. One thing you could do say the current params are the following,  Here's a trace of all of the changes since the inception of Shelley plus a rationale for all of the changes. Which might be useful from a historic perspective.   
**D** - We did discuss last time. I think the conclusion we came to, is that proposals changes should be as standalone - fitting with the CIP context of proposals, not _definitive_. There is no commitment of any party to implementation, so really they have to be independant. I think it makes sense to update it when the changes happen on-chain. So proposals should be separate CIPs, well-reasoned proposals. And this should be updated here when it changes on-chain. But if people want to make proposals that should be as a separate CIP. I think we requested to provide a template to propose a param change.   
**K** - seems right, it feels that it might be on the Editor's role to provide that template.  
**S** - I'm ok with no template. Else I recall as Duncan, I agree changes should be standalone CIPs. I'm ok with merging meanwhile.  
**K** - What we could do is say any changes to Parameters should be submitted as a CIP including the name of the Parameters.   
**D** - this should be made clear in this CIP that the change proposals should be as separate CIPs, not as changes to this one.  
=> Moved to Last Check  

#### HD Stake pool cold keys   
([PR56](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/56) - potential CIP-xxxx)   
**Michal** - We can add Rafael for the technical explanations. This proposal was added yesterday, but what we propose here is deterministic derivation of stake pool cold keys. We propose a derivation path as seen. Time is critical because we are trying to push this ledger app by the end of January.  This approach will also enable to operate multiple stake pools from a single HW wallet.  
**S** Is it feasible to derive a hardened key from a non-hardened parent?  
**Rafael** not sure, maybe there are security considerations, thanks for avising.  
**S** - I don't recall off the top of my head. I can look it up.  
**M** - Tried looking on the BIP32 paper. We're going to have to spend more time into this to dispell concerns.  
**R** - The non hardened Index was really for convenience but could be replaced by hardened for convenience. (see last paragraph in the PR).  
**F** - the ask is to clarify the hardened feasiblity. Can we merge? Ok with numbering?  
**R** - For number rationale it's in line with 1852 as a root index. The stakepools aren't logically related, it should make sense to add it as a distinct index.  
**F** - As soon as we start diverging, it's opening the door to wild numberings for CIPs..  
**Michal** - who will be responsible for validation on Hardened/non-hardened point?  
**S** - I just looked it up now, in practice it's allowed but it means you'll only be able to derive the cold key index from a private key. So if you have a public key of the usecase then you won't be able to derive any child keys. Having usecase non-hardened is kinda pointless.   
**R** - This was reserved for future cases. Someone may come up to proposal to derive non-hardened cold-key (for whatever reason).  
**S** - Is that why the usecase field non-hardened?  
**R** - Yes. In the rationale, we explain the non-hardened derivation usecase says that "in the future" it might be convienient to derive non-hardened cold keys. There could be future motivation for multiple non-hardened cases.   
**S** - So in the future we might need a table for all the usecase values, are you suggesting all usecases be soft-derived rather than mixed (hard and soft)?  
**R** - yeah  
**S** - I can't see why we wouldn't have hard only for now, and future non-hardened spectrum  
**R** - I can do that modification and point out that future usecases might take from the non-hardened cases (if it makes sense)  
**Michal** - Can we agree you do not see any issue with this CIP and that there are no blockers on path as-is (beyond the hardened thing).  
**F** - Even though there is a need to have this working from Ledger - there is no need to have CIP inclusion   
**Michal** - There is no functional blocker, but if we implement it in some way but later change how the cold keys are derived then we could have multiple derivation paths.. We should work on a decision that is final.  
**S** - Agree. I feel this is fine, including the numbering.   
**F** - It would be merged on the 28th if we move this to lastcheck.  
**D** - What does it mean when you have a level hardened and the sub-level non-hardened?  
**R** - right now for the coldkey index being hardened there is no real point, but for the sake of future proofness. The premise was that other usecases for the coldkeys might arise in the future and those future usecases might find it suitable to have their childkeys non-hardened.  
**D** - So 'some' usecase would have their (sub) cold keys non-hardened and some hardened. If 'usecase' is hardened then its hardened all the way own?  
**R** - If you have a usecase hardened, then you cannot use the root key (purpose & cointype) & use that to derive the usecase and child keys because those are hardened. But if usecase is non-hardened, then you can derive those.  
**D** - Is there a case in the future where you'd want to derive the 0th this as well as the 0th that?  
**R** - Yes.   
**M** - It sounds to me we are using 'usecase' as a different 'purpose'. It would be simpler without a 'usecase' and if you need a set of keys for a different Purpose then you pick a separate purpose...  
**D** - ex: we have SPOs now, suppose in future we have a governance mechanism involving onchain voting through some indirect democracy, where you delegate to someone and they vote for you. To register as someone that folks delegate to, that would be much like registering as a SPO and we would want to manage the keys the same. Same pattern. If I want to register as many ppl they would all be different. I think Matthias is right. Keep usecase but only for things that are really the same. But otherwise, use a different purpose. so all the conditionals can be under a purpose.  
**R** - Having the usecase hardened then?  
**D** - Yes.  
**R** - Agreed, and later (if somehow needed) we can still add non-hardened usecases.  
=> Move to Last Check
