## Summary

Rough writeup of 4/13/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.

### Triage  


### Last Check   

#### Key Serialization Formats
([PR57](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/57) - potential CIP-0016) 
**Duncan & Matthias** - All good / ready to go.   
=> Merging NOW.    

#### Multi-signatures HD Wallets
([PR69](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/69) - potential CIP-1854)
**Matthias** - This should benefit from Sebastien's review. Which is a fari point and really argues about the design - I touched to it earlier today.   
**Sebastien** - What I put out in my comment isreally the privacy, but if folks are not worried then that's not a big issue. Meanwhile also the scaleability, for example if we start having multiple derivation. Because Any change to one of those would have an impact on  the other which bundles/combines them generally. If you're ok with leaving everything under 1852 and conveying to the user the implications, then I'm ok with that. I think your proposed solution of generating more accounts to handle this does not work well inerlight (?) already supports multi-accounts for wallet, so if they derive account 1, 2 3 ... They might run into a multisig account, which would be undefined as to how to handle..  
**D** - Can I get the concern summarized?  
**M** - The idea of this proposal is to extend the 4th role/level of the HD derivation scheme so have two new derivation paths, '3' and '4', which would identify multisig key or keys used in a multisig context. That level is normally internal address, external address or stake key. These are WITHIN an account. And so if you want to share your keys with your cosigner you have either to share your account's public key, which by soft derivation they can derive both your multiderivation key or stake key, OR you have to share two keys: The key at level 3 and the key at level 4 so they can both be sub-chain derived. If you have to share your account key, it means you also allow your cosigner to derive your payment keys. Only the public ones, yes, but you give away some privacy. In principle if you want to use Multisig, then you would use a dedicated account for that, only containing multisig keys. If you have the multisig keys in an account, they might get discovered and it could get messy...  
**D** - I think it's inevitable that different account are going to be for different purposes - and it's not going to be feasible to have the wallet generically treat all. This one for multisig, this one for contracts...   
**S** - Wether we want multisig to be handled by different accounts or do we want multisig to be handled by different "purpose" and so whenever you restore a wallet in Deadalus or Yoroi, you'd pick at the beginning of the restore if you'd be restauring a multisig wallet.
**D** - The Downside is that every new kind of thing you want to use it for is a different set of accounts...  
**M** - This goes against the principle laid out in the CIP for 1852, where we give the general structure, and the 4th level is used as a hole (where we have 0,1,2)...  
**S** - For Catalyst, we have a voting key - and it would simpler if we had a voting key chain. If we said Role 3 is a voting key chain (**M** - Why not) the voting key could be deterministically derived by incrementing the index. so (0,1,2,3) would be (external, internal, staking, voting key) and multisig would effectively be (4, 5, 6 and 7)... and every time we'd want to add a standard, we'd have to look at this and the multisig path equivalent and it might get messy.  
**M** - I get your point: you want to reflect the existing strucure also on the multisig. It's always going to have the same set of roles...  
**S** - Yes, and so if we change the derivation path / purpose type, I feel it's not a big deal. The wallet keep track of your root private key so the key stays the same and you need the password to derive a new account just like you'd need the password for a new purpose so it feels like not much work and would keep things tidier..  
**D** - So in my wallet, I want to have a bunch of accounts, some will be for some purpose while others will be for different purposes: voting multisig or other. The question I presume if how do we reflect this in the HD structure itself  
**S** - That's the reason why 'purpose exists' in BIP44 specs. We can use it that way if we want to, but we do not have to. I think it's slightly cleaner if we do that way. If we keep 1852 and generate new rules, I would at least argue to make them non-sequencial such as 100, 101, 102 as a namespace so that if things get added inthe future we have room. Changing the purpose I feel would be slightly cleaner. 
**D** - What about cointype, is this used?   
**M** - It's not used but it would likely do more harm than good to remove it.  
**D** - What about to use it? If we're trying to say there are different kinds of account, or roles, it seems fair that it should live above the account rather than below.   
**M** - You mean having a non-hardened path before the acount?   
**S** - It's mostly to prevent collisions or clashes with other cryptocurrencies.   
**D** - So even though cointype is the second level, in some sense it's the top level.  
**M** - Yes, has to do with how things where specified: In BIP44 the 'purpose' gives you the rest of the structure: It tells you there is an account type. Conceptually it's below in term of hierarchy.   
**D** - So cointype has to be registered with HW wallets and such but purpose can be changed, it makes sense to have accounts with different roles.  Wherever we already have staking keys within an account, then it makes sense to have these - these are things within an account. But when it touches to roles within an account it makes sense to move that higher in the derivation tree.   
**S** - Purpose is my preferred choice as well  
**M** - It's also relatively easy to change.  
**D** - What was the tradeof you were initially thinking of?  
**M** - The main reason to try to have this as the same account is that it felt a bit unnatural for sharing: People already know how to share account public key - and if I wanted to share my account with someone else, like cosigners or such - having this as an extension within the account would make sense. The same account used for a different purpose would mean sharing account (with a different purpose) not the entire wallet itself.  
**D** - But in some sense, if we were to do it this way, it would still not be the entire wallet, rather all accounts within the wallet.   
**M** - We're very much account-centric in all the wallets that we have. Using 'A' particular account and then addresses within that account. 
**D** - I think that's ok logically for the user: "there is a set of accounts". Instead of having ONE heterogenous-style account, then you have several Homogeneous accounts characterized by the role/purpose first.  
**M** - For the purpose also, the natural thing then would be to change the purpose, but also piggyback on the structure of the 1852 wallet - but I really don't like this internal chain for which we have no use of for any wallet - inherited from the BIP44 design: To have different derivation paths for the internal addresses and external addresses is useless and only adds up to the complexity. That's also the rationale to have only two path: payment and stake keys, period. No Internal/external payments.   
**D** - You could also use the external one always - and ignore the other.  
**M** - That would be a bit weird but maybe more consistent, because we could say "look at this overall spec for the rest of the path" or "we have a new purpose and define the new path in CIP xxx"...  
**S** - I would specify the same thing and state that "internal is unused"  
**D** - This should probably be added to 1852: "as we add more kinds of accounts, we will add new purpose, but yet outllining we keep the cointype".   
**M** - I will update 1852 as part of this PR  
**S** - I'm fine with it. If we want to modify 1853 to mention it or leave as is, either works.  
**D** - I think we should capture it somewhere so the next person that comes along and wants to do it for new things... and make it consistent.  
**D** - => 1852 defines the pattern of extension. i.e. "when you want to extend this with a new kind of account (..)" Perhaps we might need some other type of accounts in the future, which should be done by keeping the same cointype but adding a new purpose.  
**D** - CIP-1854 would therefore be its own CIP as it is now. We've sortof made two decisions here - the right pattern of extension is (local), but the GENERAL pattern of extension should also be documented as part of CIP-1852.  
**M** - I will ammend this CIP. And also ammend CIP-1852 to clarify that for future use. It's really for different kinds of accounts. For things like the voting key, the "role" is still a better fit: you want it to be part of your normal account but also have it shareable as an extension of the role makes sense, so you can have it as part of the normal account or the multisig account. Having that as an extension of the role makes sense. Just change the purpose if you want to have a multisig-shared voting key OR have it fully owned by yourself. Maybe we can change the naming within the HD tree to clarify the (1st) one should be the account purpose, and the (4th) role as the key purpose WITHIN an account.   
**D** - So for 1854 you would go back to using just 0 an 2, and 1 would be unused. Ok. If Matthias is fine to do changes, it would be good as Last check again.  
=> Moved to Last Check (to be merged in two weeks)  

### Review  

#### Update to CIP-0015    
([PR71](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/71) - Update to CIP-0015: "Catalyst Registration Transaction")   
**S** - Test vectors have been updated and validated so this PR is ready to merge. In Fund4 the structure changed slightlyy. I spoke with the Catalyst folks about the changes and adjusted the difference in the test vectors by the dryruns - and Samuel helped review too. I am fairly confidient in those changes.  
**M** - In the first sentence, isn't this the "Hash" of the CBOR encoded metadata? I know that that was changed recently - it used to be the cbor, but then was changed to the hash for space.  
**S** - Probably right - we need to updte this PR to not touch CIP-0015 as all.  
**M** - Ok - [PR71](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/71) is adding test vectors, while the other (([PR79](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/79)) will modify CIP-0015 directly.  
=> Moved to Last Check (to be merged in two weeks)   


#### Update to CIP-0015-1  
([PR79](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/79) - Update to CIP-0015: "Catalyst Registration Transaction")   
**M** - (Summarizing) This was reviewed by the Vaccuum Labs team, who are also doing the HW Wallet impl. At this stage we know this work is 'ok': we've been able to do light multisig test locally...  
**M** - This one touches to the changes themselves  
**S** - They closed the old PR and created this new one - I haven't had time to look at it yet. I think that Vacuum Lab comments is very fair and we need to have a look at that conversation. I think that defining the nonce as the slot number makes a lot of sense  
**D** - That's not a nounce, that's a counter. A nounce is Entropy.  
**S** - This should be changed to min slot number. Once that's done, everyone will be happy.   
**F** - Does it make sense to rename it?   
**M** - Quite many things to look at.   
**S** - I think we can move it to 'Last Check' because the last unknown is this field / nounce thing. Let's move to Last Check, will resolve this for next meeting.  
=> Moved to Last Check (to be merged in two weeks)  


#### Cardano Addresses    
([PR78](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/78) - Potential CIP-0019:"Cardano Addresses")   
(**M** - HOPING INTO 76 - see below in Discussion)  
**M** - This is documenting what exists and giving more details on the Byron parts, with some test vectors for ppl to use. Some of it deals with the address space and some of it looks at the behind the scenes.   
=> Moved to Last Check (to be merged in two weeks)  

### Discussions  

#### Update to CIP-0003 
([PR76](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/76) - Update to CIP-0003)   
**M** - This isn't an actual CIP but a clarification on an actual CIP that we reviewed with Sebastien - Why Trezor is using a different derivation format from the seed to the master key with the 24-word mnemonics.. Vaccuum Labs just heard back from Trezor and this was basically due to an earlier bug that eventually had to be kept for continued compatibility.   
**S** - OK with merging it, good to go.    
=> Merge Now. 


#### Static Website   
**M** - Do we want to advertise the [static website](https://cips.cardano.org/) a bit more? What is blocking here? It's a bit easier to digest than the github site itself.  
**F** - The meetings, the platform are not getting the engagement it probably deserves - Do we WANT to advertise it?   
**M** - I think we do, I think developers.cardano.org should link to it.   
=> Added to a the retro for discussion.
