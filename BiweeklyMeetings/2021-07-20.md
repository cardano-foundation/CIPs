## Summary

Rough writeup of 7/20/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.  

## July 20 2021 notes 

**Attending Editors**: Matthias Benkort, Sebastien Guillemot, Duncan Coutts, Frederic Johnson. Editorial Guest: Robert Phair.


### Triage  

#### Followups
([PR66](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/66) - "Fair Min Fees")  
**Frederic** - Process-wise we want to make sure that 3 out of 4 of the main editors have transparently approved the request. In this case you can see there are 3 already and is good to go as-is.  
=> Merged as CIP-0023  

([PR21](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/21) - "Non-Centralizing Rankings")   
**F** - The CI checks were throwing errors - Clark (CF) helped push a PR to try addressing - how would you want to proceed? I propose we can push this through and adjust later as Draft.   
**M** - Unless Shawn has blocked it we can do a rebase of his branch by default. Will look into it.  
=> Merged (CI Resolved)  

#### Forging keys
([PR96](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/96) - "Forging policy keys for HD Wallets")  
**M** - (checks gathered, good to merge)  
=> Merged as CIP-1855  


### Last Check   

#### Delegation  
([PR82](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/82) - potential CIP-0017: "Cardano Delegation Portfolio")   
([PR86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86) / Update to CIP-0013: "Cardano URI Scheme")   
**F** - This has about delegation portfolio, can someone update on the state of this PR?  
**Matthias** - It hasn't changed for a month or two. That's mainly describing a JSON format for representing portfolios that can then be shared with wallets or application dealing with delegation such as SPOs. There were some divergence of opinions between Robert and I regarding what sort of structure we should try to go with for portfolios - try to offer decimals or units. Robert has a proposal that would have the SPOs represented in-URL, transporting some information in that medium, allowing decimals for weights - Not sure if we have really settled the discussion there or not Robert because there are arguments in both directions but I still don't really see why allowing decimals in weight would be useful since we can represent any number with a matter of integer fractions (multiplying the fractions by some numbers..)  
**Robert** - We have one or two pathological cases that came up when looking at how people would practically use them if the fractions / decimals are not allowed, like the case where Stakepool weights will default to 1. If we want a long list of reducded delegation then we can't use a number less than 1 to indicate a fraction. And there were two or three cases like that we reviewed in the prior meetings, also documented in the PRs. If anyone has specific ideas regarding if those cases are problems or not. We could try to add to the PRs and have them confirmed there? All of them would be about similar kinds of boundary conditions. Some of them didn't emerge until we considered how stakepool links could be made more concise, which is why the advantages of using fractions never really came up when the json portfolios were being considered, where you basically have an arbitrary ammount of precision in files that can have any size. But then the problem needs to be considered differently if you're trying to constraint the delegation portfolio within the space of a URI (PAUSE). It may be that "weither the decimals are appropriate for the json or not" is actually a separate question, of weither they are appropriate for the stakepool URIS. That's why I don't feel the differences HAVE to be resolved. It could just be that the datatype for the stakepool weighta would be more sensibly integers for the json file and would be decimals for the URI. I think we could go ahead with the plan to merge as they are, rather than try to reconcile a conflict that isn't really there.  
**Duncan** - Makes sense. No space constraint in the json and there is in the URI.  
**F** - [PR86](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/86) changes an existing CIP - [CIP-0013](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0013/README.md) while [PR82](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/82) would be a brand new CIP - Does it seem fine in that way?  
**M** - Yes, this is just an addition to an existing CIP, it doesn't invalidate what exists, just adds new primitives.  
=> Merge ASAP  

#### NFT
([PR85](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/85) - potential CIP: "NFT Metadata Standard")  
**M** - Did Alessandro get time to update as requested last time - or update to the latest format? The idea was to merge "as-is" since it is being used by a lot of people. Did work begin on the next version / possibly a JSON schema version?  
**Sebastien** - I have not had the time to manually compare the JSON to see if it really matches: Can someone confirm that the commit that got added (since we last spoke about it) made it match with existing wallets and explorers? That was the only real concern with this - that the readme might not actually match what was implemented..  
**Clark** (in chat) - "What will happen to the minted NFTs already by the way?"  
**S** - The NFTs on mainnet use this specification or a variant as mentioned in comments on the PR (instead of the actual Readme) - that was the main open question and it looks like there was a commit since then to match the spec. I was hoping if someobody in this meeting might be able to clarify that this looks good here (but looks like there is nobody... ) I'll approve this PR, under the assumption that the commit fixes what was expected to be fixed.  
**D** - Add that comment in your PR review and then we can proceed. This is not for last check is it?  
**F** - It is.  
**M** - There are a lot of good ideas on how to improve this one but that CIP has already been implemented by quite a few tools. One idea is to produce a new CIP version of this one, including all we discussed about format and structure so far, deprecating this one afterwards. Propose we merge [PR85](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/85), then modify it later through a new PR/version.  
**D** - Right.  
**F** - Should we move back to Last Check?  
**M** - Good to merge, as soon as we get the go ahead from Alessandro that he added what was needed.  
=> Merged ASAP once ok'd by Alessandro  


#### MSK Wallets
([PR83](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/83) - potential CIP: "Multi-Stake-Keys Wallets")  
**F** - This is setup as a 'Last Check'. Going through prior meeting notes, everything should be fine re:merging.  
**M** - Yes, all good. I will double check with Yohanes on the side because ihe has been working on an implementation to confirm that the CIP is actually sound. We will make an update to [CIP-0010](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0010/) to point to a first implementation of it (for reference) but it's not necessary right now.  
**D** - So is it an extension of the existing CIP that states you use index [0] and you have to folllow the derivation index?  
**M** - It's a bit more than that: we use a **special UTXO**, crafted from a stake key so that we can actually track which is the last stake key that is **registered** on the blockchain and this way, restoring the wallet on different machines/platforms and be totally resillient to the decentralized aspect of all this.  
**D** - So you look at it by checking at what is registered on the chain?   
**M** - Yes, we have one UTXO that gets consumed and produced for every Stake key registratiom, which makes sure that all stake key registrations are actually sequentialized. You cannot double spend your UTXO so cannot double register a key concurrently, and if any Registrations get rollback, then you get the whole chain is rolled back because of the UTXO chaining. We have outlined a number of problem, a lot of that using some good property testing - up until the point we arrived at this idea here to propose solving all of that. It's rather cheap and transparent for the user and so is the best compromise between UX and usability we found, which still lets us completely manage the multi stake key wallets without requiring any offchain information.  
**D** - Does that chain of UTXOs mean that all the stakekeys can be grouped together?   
**M** - "Grouped together?"  
**D** - That they are related to eachothers: Does the privacy disappear again?  
**M** - No. Or Maybe.. You could identify probably that 'a' particular registration is linked to another registration because if you know the previous stakekey, it will... registration certificate for a new stakekey and you could link it to the previous one. It doesn't completely solve the privacy issue because you could still rollback the registrations on the chain and get it back. I don't know if we could solve it really because you would always have a link to your previous stakekey or known stakekey, unless if we only use stakekeys that are only used for registration.  
**D** - The Privacy is not really a requirement.  
**M** - Privacy makes things better than the current situation because it is a bit more involved, but it would still be trivial to write a script to crawls the chain and unroll / get all registrations of prior keys (unless if using UTXOs only for registration..)  
**F** - Did you get answers regarding Marcel's comment? Should this be merged?  
**M** - Yes. We were wondering about maybe adding a diagram to the proposal to maybe make things clearer but we have not yet come with a clear enough diagram, so that might be a future edit. Good to merge I think. Enough information in it already to work out an implementation and we will add a link to a reference implementation in Haskell when ready.  
=>(asking for approvals for merge from Duncan/Sebastien, Matthias checking in)  


### Review

#### DApp
([PR88](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/88) - "DApp connector")  
**Rob** - (PR Author) - This PR here is similarly to something we've implemented for ERGO. It's similar to what Metamask does - it does some code injection to expose a bunch of endpoints for user wallets for DApps and it's trying to standardize this so that we can have one standard that all DApps and wallets can use (instead of having separate competing things). The conversation is ongoing on the PR already, much has been about changing the signing endpoint so far (still need to be decided), newer conversation around how to handle what happens when multiple wallets implement the same spec (how should it be handled?). Also how we want the API - as a free floating function or entirely contained within the cardano instance: be returned from that said fn() as opposed to be injected (in a two phase injection).  
**M** - What do you mean "what happen when multiple wallets implement..."  
**R** - How the spec work right now is kinda like a two phase code injection: The first phase injects a free floating function, that DApps can use to request access to user's wallet, and then the DApp can call that and the user sees a confirmation box in their wallet, and if they accept, then the rest of the API gets injected (getUTXO(), getBalance() ... etc). But what happens if there are two separate wallets? if Yoroi implements it, and Adalite implements it - that is they would both be injecting the same code...  
**M** - but you wouldn't be using both at the same time...  
**R** - You'd still want to choose which wallet gets open. Right now if Yoroi injects first, Adalite override the fns that the API that Yoroi would have already injected. We're going to have to figure out a way around that. I posted some into the PR, have possible suggestions.  
**M** - My strawman suggestion is to go with namespaces: Register a particular ID for your wallet app - we can have that registry somewhere on the CIP. Then Yoroi, Adalite can have identifiers / be listed. New wallets can pick new ones. If you have many wallets that start injecting random Javascript in your page it might start becoming heavy. I don't think many people will use many wallets anyways.  
**R** - It's an edge case, just something to consider.  
**M** - There's also the case of other applications trying to inject things (instead of a wallet).  
**R** - That's why we don't have super-generic names for the most part.  
**M** - My only real worry is on the security aspect of it - all of that happens in the client/browser in a way and is very much hidden from the users. As a User you get prompted some things and you type in your passphrase or something like that .. and it's very easy for an evil DApp to inject itself and harvest your data. I am not sure how Metamask handles that problem.   
**R** - Do you mean the code impersonating the DApp or the wallet or both?  
**M** - The wallet  
**R** - It could do that and could return whatever it wants to and possibly cause the DApp to do something you don't want to. Assuming that's the worry you had?   
**M** - The DApp itself could be malicious - it could harvest passphrase or other. For example asking for a signature, where the wallet would require a passphrase to decrypt your key - which is typically handled by the wallet.  
**R** - For the signing we are implementing a different CIP - I think CIP-0008 the messaging spec. Are you talking about a keylogger?   
**S** - The concern is that you're using a DApp, and you click "sign" and it pops up a FAKE Yoroi... (**M** and basically anyone can inject javascript in the page)  
**R** - I see - that's significant.  
**M** - I've seen DApps impersonating Metamask - and they look like it but they are actually cataloging information on your behalf - they might not have access to your wallet but if you are using the same passphrase multiple places then you might be opening yourself to vulnerabilities.  
**R** - Do you know how Metamask handles that?  
**M** - I think a blogpost warning users to be careful?  
**S** - Banks solve this at account creation and picking a picture out of a few different options and every time you go and access the bank it displays that picture (and if not your picture then you are accessing a fake version of the bank). We could do some version of this but you know, it would be 'an extra page' the user has to confirm and I am not sure how people would understand the system (or why it exists => it might not help that much)  
**M** - We need some way, not only to authenticate the DApp onto the wallet but also the DApp on the wallet. The user needs to check that he/she is dealing with the wallet he expects to be dealing with and not some other fake app. Beyond all the UX and API we've made so far, I think there is a big big question around the security aspect of that one.  
**R** - Would that be in scope for this? It would make sense to have a security section in there, but not sure about "mandating" things.  
**M** - I worry about wallets going on and implementing this without looking at the security concern. If we just push it out as a "wallet concern", that's taking the risk that all the wallets will get it wrong.   
**R** - There are several areas for security where the wallets will have to be cogniscent so that it should be "provably secure" rather than "making it work". Do you think we should have some standardized "wallet authentication system"?  
**M** - Yoroi has the little 'visual checksum' when you access your wallet, that only you know in principle (unless you share screenshots). It could be that every popup has that checksum in place and you could control that you are acessing your wallet. this might be a sane way to make sure you are actually dealing with your Yoroi wallet. We could suggest that implementation push for a proof that the user is dealing with the wallet (they are expecting to deal with).  
**R** - And on the flipside: can you think of concrete example/attack where the DApp is being impersonated (rather than the wallet)?  
**M** - In the PR comment I gave one example around the signing function: If you are actually signing anything, do not sign an arbitrary message, and make sure you only return the witnesses and not the fully serialized transaction. As a DApp you only want to get the signature produced, you don't necessarily trust the wallet to have returned you the right thing. You want to reconstruct the tx body YOU have constructed - you want to get signatures for that and THEN do the combination yourself. You don't want to blindly trust the wallet for a serialized thing. If you blindly trust whatever you get serialized from the wallet without actually checking that this is what you passed in the first place, then that's bad.  
**R** - There was also some discussion around partial signing as well for more complicated usecases..  
**M** - A tx is not by default valid after a signature: could be  multiple signers required, or other arbitrary reqs.. I think that should just be the default of the API actually: you pass a particular body and you ask for a signature from one of the wallet keys, and as a DApp you have constructed the transaction so you know what to expect (e.g. if multisig you know you will require a sig from the other user)  
**R** - When you say we were trying to sign from one key, are you specifying which key to the wallet somehow or..?  
**M** - The idea is to point that to a particular input although in practice not only inputs require signatures: That's fine for payments but if we go a bit deeper down the Alonzo path, you can sign pretty much anything. Consider 'certificates' even - that's not even pointing at an input, that's pointing to a stakekey, or at a certificate. The signature should have a way to point to anything in the tx as "I need a signature for that particular certificate" -> the wallet should know which key corresponds to that and produce the appropriate signatures (after approval by the user) OR you request a public key (and the wallet can product a signature matched to that key). Might be public key hash rather than public key. I don't need a way to point to what element needs signed really, it could be many things. Or you give out the keyhash you expect a signature from.  
**R** - Are there possibilities where the keyhash might be a bad idea?  
**F** - short on time, let's move this back to follow-on meeting for discussion.  
=>Discussion in the PR itself - To be Reviewed again next meeting   


#### Collateral
([PR104](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/104) - "Collateral key derivation")  
**S** - Background here - as of Alonzo, all txs that call smart contracts will require collateral inputs. That collateral input has a few restricitions: it cannot contain any tokens and cannot be locked by any script. It has to be just ada. You can reuse your regular inputs as collateral inputs, they don't have to be separate, but there's no guarantee that the wallet has valid collateral input. On top of this, there is a minimal collateral you have to put up, to cover the tx fee for the smart contract yet nothing is stoping you from overcollateralizing. This isn't too dangerous because txs calling smart-contracts should never fail if all goes as planned. Yet some Qs remain such as how to handle HW wallets. Historically the HW wallet prompt you for every field in the Tx, so should we show the user of the HW wallet how much collateral they are putting up? This might be concerning for the HW wallet users calling a smartcontract, they might be confused by a prompt asking if they are "OK with a collateral of xxxx ada" but this might be the right way to go about to protect against a hostile app. That's the kind of consideration taking place. My main concern is about input selection: all wallets have to select which inputs to use for a tx, and because of this collateral system, the wallet has to make sure that there are always inputs 'suitable' as collateral input, so some UTXO with no tokens on it that isn't blocked by a script. If you don't have UTXOs matching those requirements, the wallet will have to prompt you "You have no UTXOs that fit these requirements, you need to rearrange the UTXOs to be able to use this contract": Imagine on Ethereum if you were trying to quickly call some uniswap smart contract while trying to make a swap and your wallet prompts for a UTXO swap... wait for a few minutes for the Tx to be confirmed before you can actually call the contract (by which time someone else might actually have called the swap) ... This is a really poor UX, where the reorg has to be confirmed and so we want to minimize the number of time you have to do that rearrangement because it's such a UX hit. The easiest way IMO we can reduce the number of times we have that happening is by speciying a **new derivation path**: I added a new derivation path at index [3]: So we have External Chain at [0], internal Chain at [1], staking key at [2] and collateral key account at [3]. Any ada put into this will be a flag to the wallet, basically "don't spend ada from this address unless you have to". That way if you ever have to rearrange your UTXOs for a DApp, then it knows to use this as collateral. This makes sure that all wallets in the ecosystem are not actually stepping over eachothers and spending their collateral inputs. This should minimize the ammount of time that users have to do any rearrangements. There is a problem with this specification, it increases what the user has to know - here that there is this new derivation path for collateral. We can make it very explicit for the user i.e. "You have this collateral address, here's how much collateral you have". Or we could make it implicit (as an implementation detail): there's that colleteral account and we don't tell the user it exists (and we let the wallet manage it for you). I prefer being explicit about it, I think this is up to the wallets themselves. I feel having this derivation path is the right thing to do because it will minimize the number of rearranges required.  
**M** - This makes sense to me although I haven't followed the discussion in the PR - I saw 60 messages and felt there were already enough people  discussing.  
**S** - Most of the messages I feel are going down a different path maybe, focusing on weither or not some contract could fail or the implications of failing (which I feel are valid considerations). IMO the more important thread is about trying to minimize the rearrangement, but it being a more subtle topic, folks tend to go to the more flashy aspects.
