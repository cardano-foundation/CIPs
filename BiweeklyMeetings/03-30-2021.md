## Summary

Rough writeup of 3/30/21 Editors meeting notes taken during that day's CIP meeting, to increase transparency and dialogue with the community regarding proposed changes, implementations and considerations.  
<sub>_Notes might contain errors or miss pieces - call out issues as needed_
</sub>  
Editors meetings are [public](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly), [recorded](https://www.crowdcast.io/cips-biweekly) and [summarized](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/BiweeklyMeetings): do join and participate for discussions/PRs of significances to you.  


## Editors Meeting Flow

- [x] **Triage/Review**: Some CIPs might fall out of grace or not get updated, a CIP that hasn’t seen activity for 3 months should be checked on, and appropriate action taken. Ex: did any of the recent changes obsolete current CIPs? Consider ‘Active’ -> ‘Obsolete’ transitions..  
- [x] **Last Check**: Review of the PRIOR meetings Decisions  - if no objection, apply change (effectively a two week lag from decision to action, as a grace period)  
- [x] **New CIPs Review**: CIPs up for review should be looked over collectively, with discussion where needed. (on top of the asynchronous reviews)  
PR -> ‘Draft’: Needs format + approval.  
‘Draft’ -> ‘Proposed’: Needs a PLAN towards Active + implementation.  
‘Proposed’ -> ‘Active’:  Objective criteria as laid out observed, and consensus agreeing.   
- [x] **Current Discussions**: What the current CIPs discussions are on social media / forums / Discord.  
- [x] **Close**: Recap of actions taken and decisions. List the CIPs that are due for review.  Distribution of the minutes via mailing list.  

## March 30 2021 notes 

**Attending Editors**: Matthias, Sebastien, Duncan, Frederic  


### Triage  

#### Update to CIP-0015
([PR71](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/71) - Update to CIP-0015)  
**Matthias** - Sebastien added test vectors in there. I feel that the whole Catalyst framework is moving faster than the CIP is progressing on the subject. We have a few PRs about this CIP-0015...  
**Duncan** - Sam and Sebastien are reliable sources - should be good to go..  
**Sebastien** - The test vectors work, but they only work for Fund3 - and there's a separate PR, there's two basically for Catalyst. One is for the test vectors and the other is for updating the Catalyst specifications for Fund4: Fund4 adds a new key and also changes the signing scheme: you no longer sign the full metadata payload but rather now sign the hash of the payload. This PR (which is adding test-vectors) will have to be updated because the vectors have changed. The other PR (which adjusts the specs for Fund4) is still innacurate I believe.  
=> Moved out and adding comment in the PR to touch/Update  


### Last Check   

N/A - (PR61, see below)  


### Review  

#### Key Serialisation Formats    
([PR57](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/57) - potential CIP-0016)   
**Frederic** - This is looking at the various keys using accross Cardano.  
**Matthias** - Inigo, a specialist cryptographer, has been reviewing this PR. The whole CIP is itself pretty straightforward, just putting down something that already exists and have a sanity check on it. And the feedback was positive. We knew it was designed by the previous cryptographer, and so now we have the ok from the new Cryptographer.  
**Duncan** - So Inigo looked at PR57?  
**M** - Yes. We had a chat and he wondered on the best way for feedback (if any) and I flagged that Github PR comment was the best way. He left a Review, although not part of the org. Review was OK. One note about endianness - and the question was about specifically wording it out... But since it's generalized in most places as big-endian, it would be fine to leave as-is.   
**D** - It might be better form to simply note it as "Like in most other places, this is big endian"  
**F** - Moving the status to "Last-Check" (to be merged in two weeks)  
=> Moved to Last Check (to be merged in two weeks)   


#### Multi-signatures HD Wallets   
([PR69](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/69) - potential CIP-1854)   
**M** - This is putting down what we've been designing for the multi-sig wallets. This adds new derivation paths to the 4th level of the HD tree like we did for the stake keys, but this one dedicated to multi-sig keys. This also describes how multisig wallets should work, discover addresses and communicate with each others using addresses and keys generated from this new HD subtree. There is an implementation on the Cardano Wallet as we speak that is already here. It hasn't been added to the PR yet but might be added later to link and show how this work.  
**D** - Sebastien - Does Emurgo have any future supporting plans for multisig generally?  
**S** - We had some concern about no multisig coordination server. There are a lot of projects where multisig would be useful.  
**M** - The multisig coord server will happen, but separate from this CIP. We've left out any sharing of the multisig, or the partial Tx here. But later, we'll expand with the coordination server, expected to be a partial publish-subscribe broker (you subscribe to specific channels, send your partial Tx in, and every listener gets it and can reply to your channel). This would be done ideally behind the scene by wallet softwares. This CIP is really how to manage the wallet keys in the context of shared wallets (called "shared" over "multisig" because they can also be used in many context, for example Catalyst). The idea is to define a particular template for wallet: monetary scripts with placeholders as keys for each cosigners and every instance of that template simply instanciates all keys at a particular index. The same index is used for all cosigners, and if the same cosigner appears multiple time in the template, we also use the same keys index for a particular instance. For a particular script, all the keys are derived from the exact same part to the tree of all the different cosigners' wallets - which makes it easy for the wallet to keep track of what index to use for the next address, and discover their funds / to verify the addresses belonging to their cosigners.  
**D** - It makes sense to break it down with the server as out-of-scope (intermediate Txs etc). Interested when we get to that.  
**M** - We have a few drafts on that already  
**D** - Let's discuss further as this touches Alonzo  
**M** - This CIP in the end is pretty straigthforward: All cosigners have the same index, so it makes it easy to verify. When you see a particular address you just have to discover your own key inside it, and you know that all your cosigners have used the same key, and since you have your cosigners public keys and your index, you can derive their child keys. All is derived from the structure itself, but we're also going about it sequentially. Indexes are sequential, but also we're tracking with a gap, so standard practice. It's an extension of CIP-1852 (second extension)  
**D** - Examples were using purpose as '1852', shouldn't they be using 1854?  
**M** - No, the role is changing but the purpose is the same.   
**D** - How is the script template setup?  
**M** - We use the exact same as a script but not locked to a type, and instead of a keyhash we use a cosignerID. The template is just a script with cosignerIDs and when instanciated you replace all cosignerIDs with proper keyhashes. So it has the same representation internally and also externally in interfaces we typically use json. We have a way to represent as json and the same approach for template for the template with cosigners for keyhash. The mapping of the cosigners is defined on the side.  
**D** - And you're welcoming any template?   
**M** - Yes, the only constraint is that you cannot change the template. Using a different one would be using a different account on your wallet. To be able to recover, you need to know your key, the template and also your cosigners public keys.  
**M** - For the setup phase, when you don't yet have your cosigners public key: cosignerID is just 'cosigner #1' for example. In a way because there is a one-to-one mapping it's the cosigners public key. We didn't want to include the sharing of the keys through the multisig server  because the MCS isn't going to be secured. For now at this stage the better way is to (directly) "talk" to your cosigner, through a (secure) side channel. Later on we might think of a protocol, but the implication is that the wallet needs to be created in two steps. 1) Create the shared wallet (get your credentials from that) 2) share your credentials with the cosigners (and collect theirs), finish the installation of the wallet.   
**D** - All sounds very sensible so far.  
**M** - This was also reviewed by the Vaccuum Labs team, who are also doing the HW Wallet impl. At this stage we know this work is 'ok': we've been able to do light multisig test locally...  
=> Moved to Last Check (to be merged in two weeks)  


#### Update to CIP-0015    
([PR75](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/75) - Update to CIP-0015: "Catalyst Registration Transaction")   
**S** - Let's move this one to two weeks, still significant conversation and open comments there.  
=> Send to 'Review' for next meeting 


#### Update to CIP-0013    
([PR61](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/61) - Update to CIP-0013: "Cardano URI Scheme")   
**S** - I spoke with Nico about this and we're not going to make a proposal in the foreseable future that deviates. This one is approved as-is. Considering this as "Last Check' as this was discussed multiple times.  
=> Merging NOW.  


### Discussions  

#### "Cardano Addresses"
[PR78](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/78) - "Cardano  Addresses"  
**M** - New PR for a "Cardano Addresses" - it's not final yet but I want to put it on the radar as I have been getting many questions on the subject - it specifies things that already exist but I've been getting a lot of questions so this is a good place to collect information. In the Shelley specs the Byron parts are mostly opaque... Here this goes a bit more in detail if you have to handle Byron addresses - not pressing, but good to document.  
**D** - Sensible to include. Good Unicode art!  
=> Moved to 'Review' for next meeting
