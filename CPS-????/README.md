    - 'No collateral' warning should not be shown for a tx without smart contracts. Cc @Quantumplation "I deal with literally 4 or 5 support tickets a day where people see that and get scared"


## Use cases
Wallet Users will have a better user experience. Wallet providers will have an easier time building user interfaces.

## Goals

## Open Questions
- What are the UX standards?
